Coupon codes, sometimes referred to as discount or promo codes, are a small string of letters and / or numbers used to help save you money for online purchases. Like the coupons we’re all familiar with for grocery shopping, online coupons typically offer a much larger discount to the total order value. In fact, our users typically save over $20 in just a few minutes browsing CouponChief. Why we're the best: Pays-2-Share: We are the only coupon site that pays you for submitting the coupons you find. This program, along with a coupon-finding staff of over 20 people, ensures that our site is the most comprehensive resource for saving money you’ll find online. Sign up here. Exclusive Coupons: We partner with thousands of retailers to offer you exclusive coupon codes for your next order. You can find these offers labeled with an "exclusive" flag throughout the site, so happy hunting! Printable Coupons: We've expanded our offering over the last few years to include printable coupons to the stores you love. The same huge discounts found online can now be had at your local shopping centers and malls. If you don’t want to wait for that item to be delivered, take these printed or mobile coupons right to the store. Our blog: From timely articles about saving money for an upcoming holiday purchase, to the latest money saving or budgeting techniques, or organizing tips for extreme couponing, our blog brings you the latest how to articles for maximizing savings everywhere you go.
