I just picked up a minI random lot on ebay and Noticed when I got them the colors we're different. 1st pic is the lot.. 2nd is the colors from series 1 and 1 series 3. they seem to have the same colors as series 3. My guess is they are the International ones? idk lol. but I have pics for comparison. 2nd pic is the same series 1 with series 3 for color.. and last pic is a solo Spring-Heeled Jack. his color is like no one else I have. A super bright red/orange color. he is with my whole collection for color combo.. Just wondering why these guys are diff colors?      Attached Files  20862604_10159285669120232_2090806200_o.jpg   109.17K   0 downloads  20862493_10159285666730232_288174091_o.jpg   103.3K   0 downloads  20841438_10159285668870232_351883113_o.jpg   112.46K   2 downloads  20840103_10159285688900232_1986609105_o.jpg   95.65K   1 downloads 0 Back to top #2 Mondo7 Mondo7 Budding Collector Members 59 posts Gender:Male Interests:Rebuilding/finding my original mimp collection. Posted 14 August 2017 - 10:47 AM From top to bottom of first picture: three series 1 olive green and two series 1 neon green. Next row, two series 2 neon green (different shade to series 1 neon green), two series 1 neon purple and a series 1 yellow. Last row series 1 neon red (spring heel) and series 1 purple. The other pictures are series 1 neon and olive green and neon purple and (regular) purple. Some people call them dark purple and thistle, just to make it more confusing. The series 3 you have are uk premiums which were released unpainted in neon colours. They won't necessarily be the same shade as series 1. The spring heel looks like neon red, which can be confused with orange in some photos, it's hard sometimes unless there's one of every colour in the photo. 1 Back to top #3 MattyFreeze MattyFreeze Budding Collector Members 20 posts Gender:Male Location:NJ Posted 14 August 2017 - 10:56 AM From top to bottom of first picture: three series 1 olive green and two series 1 neon green.

Just wondering does this make them any more rare? or is that common? You are 100% correct with the colors btw thank you.  0 Back to top #4 Mondo7 Mondo7 Budding Collector Members 59 posts Gender:Male Interests:Rebuilding/finding my original mimp collection. Posted 14 August 2017 - 11:07 AM http://mimpcollectiv...-my-pocket.html Behemoth's awesome site will explain it all. Some series 1 colours were European exclusives. I think they are listed as French releases but they do turn up in UK lots, although less often. I have quite a few now but haven't bought outside of ebay UK yet. Without checking, I'm pretty certain all of those are common colors. The regional colours tend to be two neon colours of the higher point monsters. The two series 3 you have are rarer than normal but aren't as sought after as series 1 or 2. I still like them, expecially Yama and Creature From The Closet, which I think unpainted is one of the best mimp sculpts.
