Scott Sanders (aka Omega), November 15, 1977 - August 3rd 2016. R.I.P. Thank-you to our loyal members past and present for yourfriendship and discussion over the years. Find our fan page on Facebook.com. Also on: Google+ and Twitter. In 2002, at another Transformers board we loved; a change was coming. After the admin wiped all the content a new owner took over and developed it into a TRANSFORMERS roleplay site, and thus a new third rival faction was born, THE RENEGADES. The RENEGADES have been our third fictional roleplay faction since 2002. Set in our own timeline, it's origins however very much intergrate in and around Generation 1. Set before the 1986 movie, Optimus Prime had returned to Cybertron - but all was not as it seemed. His orders were confusing, erratic and some even began to question them, while all the time the DECEPTICONS seemed to be one step ahead. Was there an INTEL leak? One such bot was Latryx7, a field medic - stationed on the Autobot Moonbase with fellow Autobot Hoist. Nick-named the Dino-tamer because of his way with the Dinobots, he and Hoist repaired and fixed bots back from the front lines. Latryx7 was the first to question things and confided in Hoist - who initially refused to believe what he heard until they were sent on a mission with Latryx in charge, a mission that there's no way they could've come back from if they had not been saved by the intervention of the former Vehicon - HEAVYASSAULT. Heavyassault, the former Maximal Rhinox and Vehicon Tankor, who, upon being close to death, had his spark intercepted by the VOK on the way to the ALL SPARK. They fused the two personalities into one and Heavyassault was created and sent back in time to right his wrongs, but all he had in mind was revenge on MEGATRON. Now, in this time he saved the two Autobots as he returned with them to Autobot HQ were Optimus Prime was confronted. Unknown to everyone he was a duplicate, a clone built by Megatron to infiltrate the ranks. Elsewhere in the universe - long after the WAR OF THE PRIMES, the 13 original primes, one such Prime - LEIGO MAXIMO had been creating beast bots to fight each other for his own entertainment. When the primes stopped Leigo and killed him his body lay entombed, until his former servant JHIAXUS came calling. Taking the body off-world to a system of planets inhabited by a purple sun they crashed into a barren wasteland planet and terrofmed it into a mini-Cybertron. Jhiaxus achieved this with help a process known as budding - using his own form as a template to create new prototypes and other bots. Over time a whole system named THE HUB had a dozen mini-cybertrons. Jhiaxus continued building beast bots, but more evolved versions known as THE TRYDRANNIX. With some questionning Jhiaxus' leadership, new sides were formed against the Decepticons and thus CIVIL WAR. Decepticons rose to power for hunger for glory - ROOK, ACCIDIUS, many fell. After Jhiaxus' death and Rook's excution for betrayal, smaller camps were forumed only united by one single successor - ARVADATRON. Inspired by the tales of the great Megatron he brought with him debris from his ship and a shard crystal - part of UNICRON's dark spark. As it called to him, it had immense energy and was literally the ANTI-MATRIX. Using COLD CONSTRUCTION (Cold Construction meant drawing out new sparks from the crystal and place them within the laser core of a newly constructed body of a Cybertronain.), Avadartron would soon choose his lieutenants and new armies personally to take back CYBERTRON. Back on Cybertron the Autobots questioning Optimus began disobeying him and stopped following his orders, taking the law to the Cybertron bound Decepticons in their own hands and their own form of justice; becoming RENEGADE AUTOBOTS. In 2005 The REAL Optimus Prime being held by MEGATRON was able to escape and make his way back to Cybertron but not before the fake version had sabotaged the start of a fight back by the Autobots, leaking information about a shuttle launch shuttle which ultimatly killed Autobots like BRAWN, PROWL, RATCHET & IRONHIDE. Although Prime dealt with the fake Optimus, he gathered the Dinobots to stop the Decepticons taking Autobot City and died with the knowledge of the fake Optimus Prime operation. Megatron was badly injured in a fight with Prime and chucked off ASTROTRAIN on the way home by STARSCREAM, who himself was disposed of by GALVATRON; a newly re-formatted Megatron. Megatron had drifted across space towards UNICRON, becoming his slave. After 2005, a new age of PEACE & HARMONY was promised by new Autobot leader RODIMUS PRIME, but the RENEAGDES where still out there and a bigger thread was to come with the invasion by Arvadatron...
