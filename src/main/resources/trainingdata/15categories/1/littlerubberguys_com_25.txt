I was reluctant at first as have never been thrilled by their DBZ figures, but these seem much better.   Kinnikuman and Warsman are due in January, along with the wrestling ring stage.   They also announced 3 more figures at Tamashii Nation yesterday. Robin Mask, Neptuneman & Akuma Shogun   Finally, on top of all that, they are holding a vote for the next figures!! http://tamashii.jp/s...tner/index.html   Currently Asuraman seems next most popular, although I voted for Ramenman, Buffalo & Blackhole!!   Voting closes tomorrow, I'd love to hear from anyone who has these pre-ordered and what other characters they'd hope to have next!! 1 Back to top #2 BaltanII BaltanII Space Ninja Members 4690 posts Gender:Male Location:Delaware Interests:Daikaiju, Magic: The Gathering, Transformers, Kinnikuman Posted 01 November 2014 - 08:34 AM Good, someone got to this thread before I had to! Haven't preordered either yet because I'd like to know how they turn out first, but I might grab the stage. Unfortunately, Bluefin isn't importing the Kinnikuman figures for the US (apparently unable to get the license, can't imagine why), only the wrestling Tamashii Stage.   As for characters premiered at Tamashii Nation, there were four, not three.     Bandai show displays are always amazing. 0 Baltan II's LRG Want List - Hunting for my final MUSCLE, Red 131 Ukon, Gormiti, Jagun Fighters, and more!  My Sale/Trade Thread!

Look at how many years - since SH Figuarts started - before Master Asia from G-Gundam was finally possible to order! It's still a good sign, plus Black Hole has the benefit of being an incredibly basic sculpt and the Revoltech Mini figure released (Bandai loves to try to one-up Kaiyodo and other competitors with the same licenses).

Total with shipping came to £50, so I'm pretty pleased with that. I look forward to getting them in the new year! Hopefully we'll get a solid release date for Robin Mask soon! 0 Back to top #6 bronchuseven bronchuseven pentagonal Members 755 posts Gender:Male Location:Austin TX Posted 05 November 2014 - 06:05 AM Not a bad price at all.

I am a new user and was going to post on here about these new Figuarts Images of Kinnikuman but it appears I was beaten to it! Haha! All good! I don't know about you guys but I am salivating just thinking about the future figures! Doing my research I found these for us to gaze at to hang us over for our Kinnikuman Action Figure Fix! Here is what looks like the images of planned release (no dates I am afraid) characters.   Although not Figuarts, I thought that I should show the upcoming Revoltech Mini's as well since I plan on getting them too!

Sadly, all my votes were in the bottom eight... On the bright side, Akuma Shogun looks fantastic so far. 0 Baltan II's LRG Want List - Hunting for my final MUSCLE, Red 131 Ukon, Gormiti, Jagun Fighters, and more!  My Sale/Trade Thread!

For reference they have a site for Kinnikuman: http://tamashii.jp/special/kinnikuman/ Final poll results were as follows: So imagine they will continue with releasing Robin Mask and Akuma Shogun, but we may see the main cast of Ramenman/Terryman/Buffaloman/Brocken Jr. before Neptuneman. Asuraman and Ataru Kinniku also appear to be surprisingly popular choices!

I got aroused and excited while reading this.   Afraid not. This is the Buffaloman from Medicos. They only did Robinmask, Warsman and Buffaloman, so it made sense for me to get it since Tamashii are releasing the other 2!   Ooh, Robin Mask and Neptuneman!  Do want!  The wait until June will be tough, but it'll be worth it.  Maybe Buffaloman or Ashuraman will be released with Akuma Shogun then?  Do we know if they're going with the most popular characters first or if the pairings that make the most sense can give a less popular character a quicker release with a more popular character?   Knowing Bandai (and this goes for most figure companies) they will most likely go with whatever are the easiest sculpts (that works with their articulated base model) Akuma Shogun has already been shown, as has Blackhole, so probably those 2 next. Ramenman, Ataru and Terryman would be easy, but imagine Asuraman would be a little bit more difficult with all those arms......   Don't expect we'll see Buffaloman, Brocken Jr.or Ninja until 2016......lets hope they'll continue the line and it'll be as popular as the Dragon Ball line!!
