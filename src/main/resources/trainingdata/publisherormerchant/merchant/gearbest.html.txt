A 1. Please check whether your headphone is in pairing mode or reconnect mode and check whether your mobile phone Bluetooth search function is opened; 2. Check your mobile device’s Bluetooth menu and delete/forget the headphones, then reconnect the headphones following the instructions on user manual. QWhy my headphones won’t charge? A Please make sure both ends of the USB cable are securely connected. If you use a power outlet, ensure that the power supply is connected securely and the outlet works. If you use a computer, make sure it is connected and the USB port is powered. Turn on the headset and then turn them off. Disconnect and reconnect the USB charging cable. QWhy do my headphone disconnect with mobile phone within 10 meter? A Please check if there is metal or any other material within relatively close range that may interfere with Bluetooth connection.
