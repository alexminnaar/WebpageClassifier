Pretty much a fair trade given we got Sinkers. Jetta can still contribute as a good ordinary footballer (as Jack Dyer used to say). Sinkers is trier.   Bloodied52, Aug 23, 2017 at 11:59 AM #18 Reply astro1212 likes this.

Did well in the repeat sprints. Click to expand... Top speed is surely only relevant on the infrequent occasions a player is running a long distance onto the ball. It doesn't surprise me that some taller players have high top speeds due to their stride length. It's not uncommon to see the big defenders run down the small forwards once the forward is slowed by holding onto the ball, and the defender has had 30 metres to get up to speed. Acceleration (probably better reflected by the 20m sprint) is far more useful in common game situations to break away from packs, or getting separation on a lead. At Melbourne Frost and Hunt appear to hit their top speed from jogging almost instantaneously which makes them stand out. But they always get chased down from behind if they hang on to it for too long. Neville Jetta is on the slow side for pace, but his agility is how he counters it.   Lampers, Aug 23, 2017 at 12:37 PM #23 Reply RobbieGray17, Buzzasto DaSilva and Aeglos like this.
