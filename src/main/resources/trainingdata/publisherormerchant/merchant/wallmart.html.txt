First thing I notice is that they are much smaller than my usual brand. That I could look past since it was still a great price. My whole family tried the bars and found them to very dry and brittle. We were in such disblief that a chewy granola would be so dry we started checking the boxes to see if they were out of date. Sad to say they were not. The quality is just not what we expect from Quaker.

These bars are so great tasting you will want to keep eating them like they are a great snack and you will want more than one at a sitting. Kids love the idea of the chocolate chips and the granola bar is sweet tasting with that little bit of semi-sweet chocolate. My grandson and I love eating these Quakeroats Quaker Chewy Granola Bars with chocolate chips when ever we get together for a visit. We take them in the car, to the playground and everywhere else we go. The chewy granola bars are securely individualy wrapped. The best thing is they do not melt so the mini chocolate chips are still whole when you eat your granola bar. The bars have a plentiful serving of fiber for you body to work naturally & keeps your whole body regular from all the great nutritions in these bars.

They taste good and are a convenient snack. There's only one problem, they're SO small. If they made these granola bars longer it would be more filling and I wouldn't have to eat 2. Overall this is a great snack but they have to stop getting smaller!
