Doesn't matter anyway, I relistened to audio and misheard - he did say iMac Pro RyanSmithAT: @ryszu 2 up is a bit weird for that many down. But it should be sufficient. My guess: either upstream congestion, or a provisioning error RyanSmithAT: @ryszu How many channels? If it's somehow a 4x4 modem that might do it. Otherwise you should have ample spectrum if it's not super congested RyanSmithAT: @ryszu No RyanSmithAT: @scottwasson Agreed. Had a neighborhood block party here. It was amazing! IanCutress: Correction. He did say iMac Pro. My bad. IanCutress: Looks like too many local hotspots is causing channel contention on the WiFi at #hotchips, but they don't have direct access to the APs IanCutress: Confirmed: New Mac Pro will use Vega 10. IanCutress: That tweet sent after 10 minutes. Even mobile data is dozens of bits per second. What is going on here RyanSmithAT: Tip @Techmeme https://t.co/tUwzcumv7n ganeshts: @newfiend01 @babgvant The left shape is more Firewire-like, and the right is USB Type-A shaped. Some sort of adapter cable? ganeshts: @shanselman @avelino0 @jaredpar Verilog/SystemVerilog support? Also, automating plugin installs would be nice (my favs: MatchIt & NERDTree) ganeshts: RT @anandtech: Samsung Portable SSD T5 Review: 64-Layer V-NAND Debuts in Retail https://t.co/LXRuNxiZb4 ganeshts: @DTheSleepless Why not a UHD Blu-ray HTPC? That would be an interesting build for sure :) ganeshts: @DoeboizMyers @IntelStorage The endurance rating is hopefully 10.84 PBW and not *TBW* as mentioned here: https://t.co/cwoASmDmbf Follow @ANANDTECH   LINKS Home About Forums RSS Pipeline News Bench Galleries Terms of Use Copyright Policy Contact Us TOPICS CPUs Motherboards SSD/HDD GPUs Mobile Enterprise & IT Smartphones Memory Cases/Cooling/PSU(s) Displays Mac Systems Cloud Trade Shows Guides FOLLOW Facebook Twitter RSS The Most Trusted in Tech Since 1997 About Advertising Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017.
