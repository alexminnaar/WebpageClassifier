While it has been a very popular diet plan over the years, there are still some questions about the effectiveness of the GM diet. According to recent studies, this diet plan is indeed effective in reducing excess pounds at a fast rate. While normal weight loss strategies induce at the most of 1 pound per week lost, the GM diet can help get rid of up to 10 lbs each week by simply following its food intake regimen. At the same time however, this diet plan may prove to be overwhelming to first time users, as it involves radical change of diet intake that consists mainly of raw fruits and vegetables and reduced meat servings. The effectiveness of the GM diet should also be supplemented by a regular exercise routine, as according to nutrition experts, the diet alone would leave the individual tired and weak. Through routine exercise of up to 10 minutes each day, the body’s metabolism would be sped up and be able to keep up with the diet requirements. Followers of this diet plan would also benefit from regular exercise as they get to enjoy normal energy levels and use the pounds they shed in more productive activities.
