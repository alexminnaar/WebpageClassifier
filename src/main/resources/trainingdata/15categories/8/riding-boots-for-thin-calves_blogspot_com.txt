Howdy Slim! Riding Boots for Thin Calves Howdy Slim! Riding Boots for Thin Calves With scrawny 11.9-inch calves, I've been on a mission for years (decades!) to find the very best, most beautiful slim calf boots. There have been successes, but for whatever reason, what remain most elusive are the perfect riding boots for thin calves. Heels and wedges are challenging to find with a narrow shaft, but equestrian inspired? The toughest of all. In this blog I'll review riding boots with calf circumferences published, or reported anecdotally, at under 14 inches around. If your legs are like mine, maybe you'll find your dream boot here :) Please note: Except where otherwise stated in the captions, all photos & text are copyright this "Howdy Slim" blog and cannot be used elsewhere without permission. Saturday, July 8, 2017 Bed Stu Manchester From the first two photos, this probably looks like a happy slim calf story, right? Indeed, from the front and back this beautiful Bed Stu boot -- the Manchester -- is a narrow calf dream come true. The catch is the side view, sigh. Scroll down and you'll see what I mean. First let's accentuate the positive, as the old song goes. The Manchester is a style I've been wanting to try for years, almost since the start of my skinny calf boot reviews. I thought it had been discontinued and was pleasantly surprised to see it restocked recently. Even better, the color options have expanded to satisfy both both edgier and more classic tastes. Like the Bed Stu Glaye, the Manchester rewards you with a heady leather fragrance the second you open the box. Ahhhh. And it's got that artisanal, non-mass-produced feel that is this label's stock in trade. I'm a fan. Finally, this style uses a super clever back-lacing system with an inside panel that allows a truly custom fit at the top. I tightened the boots up easily to a top circumference of around 13" -- if not a bit smaller. Those of you who have been stopping by this blog for a while know how rare that is. The ankle circumference is pretty good, too. At 11" it's not a record breaker, but we've seen much baggier. We can work with this. If only the rest of the shaft were cut narrower, or the lacing system continued farther down the shaft. The fit, for me, got weird at midcalf, where the circumference of 14" in shoe size 8 couldn't be shrunk. Perhaps a consistent 14" up top (if I loosened the laces and lived with a gap up there -- what's new, right?) and 14" midway down would look okay, but my customizing to 13" at the opening made the boots bulge out awkwardly midway down. 'Cause no, I didn't get calf implants since my last post ;) -- those midcalf curves you see are just empty leather where these otherwise long, lean, lovely boots puff out. For shorter folks, the shaft height might also cause problems. At 18" it's tall, especially if you've got proportionally short legs. I'm not sure why, but most narrow shaft Bed Stu boots seem best suited to the statuesque. You can see in the top photo that the Manchester borders on too tall for me, and I've got long limbs for my 5-foot-4 height. To circle back to the Manchester's assets before I wrap this up, here are a couple closeups to show the super-pretty "Dark Scarlett Rustic" color, which happens to be half off as of early July, along with at least one other shade. Enjoy the summer boot steals before they blow away with the first leaves of fall!   Rating: Beauty/style: ****/5 Value: ****/5 at sale price Calf slimness:****/5 with laces tightened up top Find it at: Amazon See also: The Burnley is a new offering from Bed Stu, with a longer lacing setup -- yea! -- for full-calf customization, plus a shaft height that is kinder to us non-models :) So far I'm only seeing it at Nordstrom.

Slim calf riding boot choices remain scarce, probably for 3 reasons: 1) trendier over-the-knee styles are still dominating runways and lookbooks, with little space left for timeless knee-high boots; 2) many of us by now have learned to wear ankle boots with almost everything & have mostly converted to those, baggy ankles be damned :}; and 3) in terms of the U.S. marketplace at least, well...not sure how else to say this except that American consumers don't seem to be getting slimmer over time. If they were, we'd be seeing more, not fewer, small-circumference boots than when I started this blog 4 years ago. European countries, though? They still have their share of slim-legged boot lovers. And the boots they produce are generally pretty wonderful. But pricey. It doesn't take many fingers to count how many, say, Italian-made narrow calf boots I've found for under $400 to review here. I have often recommended ebay as a source for luxury boots, and I still believe it's a fabulous option if you've got the wherewithal to scour many listings, photographed and described somewhat inconsistently from one seller to the next. I've certainly done that, and it's yielded me some boots that I wouldn't give up for twice the price I paid.  For a more streamlined, consistent experience, though, I recommend taking a look at The Real Real, where I recently scored the secondhand slim calf Prada boots in these photos -- for about $100, shipped. Prices of course go up -- way up -- from there, but the discounts on this site are truly deep, giving us the opportunity to choose (for the same price) between a new, likely Asia-produced pair of narrowish-calf boots and a recycled pair that genuinely hugs the calves and is much more likely to be made in Europe, or somewhere else with a long tradition in working with leather and suede footwear. I could use an extra inch of shaft height on my "new" Prada boots. And they'd definitely been around the block a few times before winging their way to me. But $100 for a fun, comfy, mod type Italian-made riding style that -- with a calf circumference of 13.75" and midcalf measurement of, praise be, only 11.5" -- actually fits my scrawny legs? Hard to beat. The Real Real adds thousands of shoe, clothing, jewelry and home items per day. Items tend to go quickly, but there's always more good stuff flowing in. Best of all, most pieces are returnable within 21 days of being shipped out from TRR, so as long as you're quick about it, you can return a boot that doesn't suit. [Note: The cost was so kind on my clearance-priced, non-returnable Prada boots that I took a gamble on them, and won :) But if that's not your situation, be sure to click "Return Policy" on the specific item page to see if the piece you're eyeing is returnable.] photo (c) the real real What's on offer there today? I like these pretty Ferragamos (only $101.50, 13.5" listed calf circumference) >> << this adorable two-toned Prada pair (teeny 12" circumference, down to $87.50 as of late July) photo (c) the real real these suede & leather Jimmy Choos (only $126), 12.5" >> photo (c) the real real  <<and these second-skin Diors --an impossible-to-find 11" circumference! -- for 75 bucks, if you can believe that. (Late-July update: It's taking all my willpower not to buy these for fall! I can't believe some other skinny-legged person hasn't snapped 'em since I first posted this...) I am just scratching the surface here. Go ahead, have some fun with eco-friendly, budget-conscious luxury shopping. And be sure to let us all know if you too find something that fits! P.S. If you're squeamish about buying used footwear, well, that's understandable. After all, we can't wash or dryclean fine leather & suede boots the way we do clothing.  What I do is spray the inside of the my treasures -- being careful not to saturate the insoles and linings so much that they get warped or worse -- with the least offensive-smelling variety of Lysol disinfectant I've been able to find, in a well ventilated area. I try to do this on a sunny day so I can chase that not-so-natural sanitizing process with a natural one by setting my new used footwear outside in the (supposedly cleansing) sunlight for a while after spraying. This second step serves a second purpose of airing the boots/shoes out so they don't reek of Lysol. (As you may have guessed, I'm chemically sensitive.) Does this system work? Well, I can only speak for myself, but so far I have not acquired any weird or disgusting foot conditions from wearing gently used boots. Knock wood! :-) Posted by Mary at 9:35 AM No comments: Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: consignment, ebay, gently used, Prada Monday, March 13, 2017 Corso Como Garrison Sorry it's been so long since my last post! Honestly, pickings have been slim for narrow calf boots lately. I wish I could say I'm bringing you something ultra thin-shafted today, but the Corso Como Garrison rates higher for beauty than leg fit. It's a really pretty, classic riding boot in subtly pebbled leather that looks more expensive than it is -- especially at sale prices. The footbed features padding similar to the Sofft Sharnell's, which is unusual and a very nice touch. Inside is a soft faux-suede lining that runs all the way up the boot.   At 11 inches around, the ankle is reasonably slim in the context of what we're used to for riding boots. The midcalf is an inch or so roomier than ideal, at 14". And at 15 inches around, so is the opening up top.  These measurements should work well if your calves are on the slimmer side of average, but you'll need to  keep looking if you have truly lean legs.   The maker didn't skimp on shaft height, a plus for longer-legged folks like me but a possible dealbreaker if you're quite short or have short legs. The stat on that is 16.75 inches in size 7.5. Overall, the Garrison is an elegant riding boot that avoids trendy bells & whistles, choosing instead to deliver a streamlined, luxurious look that belies its modest cost. Rating: Beauty/style: *****/5 Value: *****/5 Calf slimness: ***/5 In black, brown or a light tan shade. Find it at: Amazon (**under $40*** in some color/size combos as of late July '17!

But I'm back with some good news. Today I bring you some great Cole Haan narrow calf boots -- the Tilley II. This style has top and circumference measurements very similar to the Cole Haan Adler boot I reviewed here two years ago, but the Tilley's ankle is about an inch smaller around, making it (for those of us with bony ankles as well as thin calves) not exactly fitted, but arguably more flattering than the Adler in that sometimes deal-breaking area. Both boots have a stretchy back side that may or may not be your thing, but overall I think the Tilley II's look is nice and sleek. Measurements for the Tilley, size 8: The opening up top is 14" around. The midcalf circumference is 13 inches. And the ankle circumference is 10.5 inches. As for shaft height, in size 8 this boot is about 15.75" tall -- so fairly petite friendly, unless you're very short or have proportionally quite short legs. The stretch section has a subtle diamond pattern to it and -- nice touch -- a strip of leather running up the back of the boot. Unlike the Adler, the Tilley isn't a pull-on style; it features a full inside zip.  The footbed is lightly padded. The sole, while not the slipperiest I've tried, isn't super grippy. So keep that in mind if you wear on slick surfaces. Caveat on foot fit: To me, the 8 feels more like a true 7.5. If you are between half sizes, my advice would be to go with the larger of your two normal sizes. And even if you're not between sizes but plan to wear very thick socks under these narrow calf boots, consider going up a half-size size anyway.

But they've shown staying power, and I've slowly warmed up to the idea -- especially with styles out now that don't flare out at the top to make thin-limbed people look like wannabe pirates. In fact, I've become convinced that some of the best boots for skinny calves out there are now OTK styles -- if you pick the right ones. Like many of you, I'm sure, I fell in love (or at least deeply in like) with an unaffordable Stuart Weitzman over-the-knee riding boot. In my case it was the soft suede Lowland style, with its narrow calf measurements, tall-enough-not-to-slip-under-my-knee shaft height and adjustable tie at the top to accommodate my thighs, which are not as skinny as my calves but still a fair bit smaller than average. The Sam Edelman boots I'm wearing in these photos, the Paloma, are of course a much less luxe version of Weitzman Lowland -- for a small fraction of the price (May '17 update: you can now score the Paloma in black for under $100). They're not made of real suede, but a soft suede-look fabric. But to my eye they win big points for style, versatility and fit. The circumferences are kind of hard to measure, as this boot is so soft, but the Paloma is around 9 inches at the ankle (yea! slim...) and around 12 at midcalf, though I believe it could accommodate a somewhat larger calf too. It's not skintight on my leg, but the lack of the wide swath of stretch goring most of the original OTK styles had is a worthy tradeoff, I think, and the Paloma is snug enough to provide that sleek "boots as leggings" look even on a thin limb. The top circumference is truly adjustable due to a toggle closure that you can tighten to your calf's content :) <<<Here's a closer look at that handy closure. I love the 23" (in shoe size 7.5) shaft height, as I want an OTK boot to stay OTK and not become an "on-the-knee" boot. Under or over, yes, but not right on the knee. And with the Paloma's shaft height, I can't imagine that happening to anyone who is not extremely tall. Caveat: There's not much grip on these soles, so I wouldn't wear them out in freezing rain. But the soft ultrasuede would probably deter you from that anyway. Sizing: I am between a shoe size 7.5 and 8 and chose the 7.5 in this boot, with good results. I'd say it fits true to size.

Find it (on sale!) at: Amazon See also: photo c Amazon Though I haven't yet tried them on, the Sam Edelman Peyton (above) and Dolce Vita Neely (below) are also reportedly good OTK bets for thin calves, with the Neely listed at an inch taller in the shaft than these Edelman styles -- a plus for the superstatuesque :) And finally -- a little wiggle room looks great, I think, on this model wearing tie-top over-the-knee boots from Anthropologie photo c Nordstrom I love the fact that all the boots in this post are so affordable. So if they turn out to be too trendy for the long haul, we don't have to feel too guilty for overspending.

That's just what the Safari style from one of my all-time favorite purveyors of slim calf riding boots, the Italian company Sesto Meucci, is offering with its curving, very subtly sparkling suede panels. In size 8, this boot measures 14 inches up top, 13.25" at midcalf and a relatively skinny 10.25" around the ankle. (Thanks Sesto for recognizing that thin calves are frequently attached to thin ankles! :)  Those sparkly suede panels add a nice curve to the ankle, too -- a shapeliness often missing in riding boots. This is a classic, streamlined shape that is feminine without being fussy. There's a panel of stretch goring for calf fit (see below), but it's narrow enough to be almost unnoticeable. Not something that breaks up the boot's long, lean line of leather. Look closely at these pix for a better look at the contrast between rich, buttery leather and soft, sparkly suede. It's a nice touch. I will say that the toe area in size 8 felt somewhat narrow, especially on my "touchy" right foot, but the terrific thing about this style is that it's offered in wide as well as medium widths, and I suspect the 8W would be perfect on me. More often than not, I'm a 7.5M, but these are Italian boots we're talking about, so sizing can be a bit different. As for shaft height, the size 8 measured 16.5 inches tall, which should work well for most calves but could hit the kneecap uncomfortably if you're much shorter than average, or proportionally short-legged. The sole is grippier than many luxe Euro boots -- a plus for those of us in unpredictable-climate areas. All in all, a really pretty find, well proportioned for slim legs.   Rating for the Safari: Beauty/style: ****/5 Value: ***/5 Calf slimness: ****/5 Find it at: Amazon (35% off as of late November 2016) 6pm (check out the video here on slender-looking legs) ~P.S.~ photo c 6pm Another Sesto Meucci beauty to check out, not yet road-tested by yours truly but advertised at Nordies as a narrow calf option and now deeply discounted at my fave shoe clearance site, is the Fibby  (pictured at left). Personally, I love a 2-inch heel like this for leg lengthening. photo c 6pm Finally, another slim riding boot with the panache for holiday dressing is the sweet, stretchy, floral-embossed Vaneli Radius (at right), listed at 14 inches in circumference but looking awfully snug on the thin legs in this video. Great deal, too!(Late May update: Almost gone...) With some weatherproofing spray, these suede slim calf boots should be able to withstand the colder months, though I'd avoid wearing them out in super-slushy messes. {Ack, sorry to bring that stuff up...forget I said anything! Happy non-slushy Thanksgiving to all! :} Posted by Mary at 10:04 AM No comments: Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: Sesto Meucci Sunday, October 9, 2016 Sofft Sharnell As promised over the summer, I'm giving the Sofft Sharnell a spin! And so glad, too, as these are some of the most comfortable boots for narrow calves I've tried on. They fit great, too :) The Sharnell's full back lace design allows for a custom calf fit -- rejoice! I was able to tighten these boots down to 13.5" up at the top opening, 12.5" at midcalf, and 11" at the ankle. Not a record setter for us here at Howdy Slim, but pretty close. As for shaft height, in size 7.5, these measured 15.75 inches tall. The full inside zipper is handy, because it lets you tighten the back laces once, tie them tightly & forget about 'em from then on. The leather is soft, supple, and has a lightly pebbled texture on my pair of Sharnells; I'm not sure if that's consistent with all the color options. An extra-nice touch is the thoughtful cushioning provided on the footbed. I haven't seen strategically placed padding quite like this before, but at least to my feet, it feels great. The toe is maybe a bit rounder than my almond-shaped ideal, but the upside of that is comfort and space for warm socks/tights. You'll notice in the pic at right that there's a cozy, leopard-print microfiber lining. And there's a rubbber lugged outsole for sure footing in slippery weather. I'm pleased with the retail price (just under $200) that will put these cute, comfy boots within reach of many readers' budgets. As you know, that's no easy find when we're hunting for a good calf fit. Thanks Sofft! Rating: Beauty/style: ****/5 Value: ****/5 Calf slimness: ****/5 In black and three different brown hues. (The one pictured in this post is "Cafe Brown" - probably the darkest of the three.)  Find it at: Amazon Nordstrom photo c Nordstrom Rack PS: I just stumbled across another pair of back-lacing tall boots for skinny legs that I need to share with you: Charles David's lovely Jayne style, nearly half off at Nordstrom Rack & even cheaper on Amazon as of March 2017! In black, a wine/brown hue or this buttery tan color. Ooh, ahh... photo c Nordstrom And finally -- if neither of the above lace-back options are available in your size and you are taller than average, consider the Vince Camuto Parle style. I'm not nuts about the metallic accent on the heel, but at a sale price under $100, I might be able to overlook that!

(Better Late Than Never edition...) photo c Nordstrom So sorry, friends. It's been a busy summer, and reviewing boots for skinny calves has had to take a back seat. Just in the nick of time, though, I spotted this pair from Sofft -- super-promising laceup riding boots that could be ideal for skinny legs, with a (presumably) fully adjustable calf circumference. I probably won't have time to grab these for a firsthand try-on before prices go up in three days, on Aug. 8, but the full retail is still pretty reasonable at about $200, so do stop back again later to check for updated pix. If my size is still available after the sale wraps, I may pick 'em up down the road. (Note: The sale's over now, as of early Sept., but the good news is that Nordies now has 4 pretty shades available rather than the original two - and this style, the Sofft Sharnell, is indeed now priced just under $200. Certainly not unreasonable for stylish narrow calf riding boots in leather rather than synthetic materials.) Besides its hard-to-find back-lacing tactic -- as often before, I wonder why more designers don't use this, as it's a great way to allow calf tightening without breaking up the nice long line of the boot from front & side angles -- the Sharnell offers, per its Nordstrom description, arch support via foam cushioning for the footbed. Another plus is the full side zip, allowing wearers to customize the laces just once and then zip on and off quickly thereafter. That may seem like a small thing, but when you're rushing, it's a huge bonus. If you grab this boot before I do, please comment and let us know how it fits!

"Pretty" isn't normally my go-to Frye descriptor -- this is still my all-time favorite boot brand, but usually its offerings are more ruggedly gorgeous than sleekly pretty. The Melissa Button Back Zip is an exception. Its soft, smooth leather is not quite as tough-seeming as you'd typically find with this label, but with some conditioning cream massaged in for weatherproofing I think it should hold up just fine. Before we get to the measurements, I need to alert you to the fact that I bought these for $134, which for Frye is unheard of outside of used boots on ebay -- and frankly, even on ebay you don't find 'em often at that price point. Do we really need to talk more about how summer is the best possible time to score a pair of classic, timeless riding boots for fall? Even if the Melissa prices go up by the time you read this, I'm betting they'll be well under retail until August, so if you love the look, now may be the time. Okay, the stats: In a size 7.5, the top circumference is a little roomy for my narrow calves, at 15 inches around. Midway down the calf is much better, at 13.5". And the ankle, at 11", is pretty skinny for a Frye model....a nice touch for those of us with knobby ankles as well as scrawny legs. Just for comparison, this style is a half-inch bigger in circumference than the Frye Jenna Inside Zip at both the opening and the midpoint, but a full inch smaller around the ankle, which I think gives it a less sporty look. Paired with the right outfit, I could see the Melissa going, in all but the stuffiest workplaces, from office to post-work drinks -- yet it would be perfectly at home at a cookout or street fair too. The shaft height is identical to the Jenna's, at 15.5 inches, which should accommodate most statures. Very pretty foot shape - but watch your step with the (too?) smooth sole Sizing advice is tricky with this one. I agree somewhat with reviewers who've suggested the Melissa runs on the small side, but I'm not sure it's dramatic enough to recommend sizing up. I would say that if you're between half sizes, you might want to go with the larger, unless you've got enough Frye experience to trust that the foot can stretch a little with wear for a custom fit. (I do actually feel this will happen with the Melissa, given the relative softness of the leather, but I can't guarantee it.) I also agree with the reviewers who have suggested this is a sexy boot :) -- subtly sexy, just the way I like. I think the back zip has a lot to do with that, along with the somewhat more fitted ankle. If you like a long, lean look on your lean legs, this is a nice pick, even though the sum of its circumference measurements doesn't put it among our skinniest Fryes. One last note: I panicked for a sec in trying to zip the boot for the first time, as it was tough to do at the very bottom, by the heel -- the part covered by the cute snap detail, which you simply unsnap to zip/unzip all the way down. By the next time around, it was working just fine :) Rating: Beauty: *****/5 Value: *****/5 at summer sale pricing Calf slimness: ***/5 In a nice range of colors, including grey, dark brown & rustic black along with the cognac I'm wearing in these pix (still priced under $200 as of mid-July! cannot beat a summer boot deal...) Find it at: Amazon (sizeable discounts still hanging in there as of mid Sept. '16) December 2016 update!  Over these past few years I've made the somewhat surprising discovery that not only do they carry many of the most gorgeous, sturdy styles on the planet, but Frye also makes, consistently, many of the best-fitting and most flattering women's thin calf riding boots we could ask for.  So I was hoping to offer you one more set of Frye pix on my chicken legs for 2016.  Unfortunately, I received the "extended calf" Frye Melissa Button boot (unlike on the style featured in main post above, there's no zipper at all on this one -- it's a pull-on) from Amazon. Not sure if it was my mistake or theirs, but I probably won't have time to exchange and get non-extended version pix out to you before the holidays :(  The good news is that based on the measurements for this wide calf version (pictured above), I feel pretty darned confident that the non-wide-calf Frye Melissa Button would look great on thin calves like mine. I am guessing they'd be at least a ***/5 for calf slimness, possibly a ****/5.  Why? Well, the extended calf measures 15.5" up top, 14" at midcalf & 12.5" at the ankle -- so even if you subtract only 1-1.5" from each of those measurements (which is a safe assumption for the non-extended boot, no?), you'll get a pretty slim fit.  Some details on the extended style that are probably relevant for the non-extended too: I am between 7.5 and 8 shoe size, and the 7.5 in the non-zip Melissa Button was a little toe tight on my toes. Maybe it would stretch, but I think sizing up to an 8 would be safer. The shaft is 15.75 inches tall. And the cognac color is a little darker than that same shade on the Melissa Button Back Zip. I like both, but the darker one maybe a tad better. They're both lovely, though.  One last word: Just like the Melissa zip, this one's got a very smooth sole! You'll wanna scuff these up on the sidewalk before sprinting around town ;) Do you own, or have you tried the non-zip Frye Melissa Button boot? Please share fit details in the comments, if so -- especially if my extrapolations from the extended version are way off base!  Happy, happy holidays to all, and a healthy and peaceful 2017 to you and yours. xo, Mary Posted by Mary at 10:50 AM No comments: Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: Frye Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom) Will these boots fit you like they do me? That depends on your measurements. If you haven't already done so, sit down, wrap a soft or paper tape measure around your calf at its widest point (usually about 10-12 inches up from the bottom of the foot), and that's your calf measurement. Mine is 11.9 inches, which definitely falls into the skinnier than average category. Anything under 14 inches is pretty slim and may require a concerted effort to fit with a stylish boot. Right under my knee, where many tall-boot openings fall, I measure 11.5 inches. My ankles are about 8.25 inches around, so finding a good ankle fit can also be a challenge. Finally, I'm about average height (5'4"), and for a knee-high look, the perfect boot shaft height for me is between 15 and 17 inches. If you're shorter, you might want to look at 13- to 15-inch-tall shafts instead.
