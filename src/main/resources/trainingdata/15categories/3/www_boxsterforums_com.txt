By comparison, the four-door Panamera is only available five ways (nine, if you include some of those same models with their wheelbases stretched a few inches). Except thats about to change, with a sleek new sportback model, as well as a range-topping hybrid sedan adding to the Panameras appeal.

From Russian meteors to Chinese firework factory explosions, the dash cam has become the darling of viral video entertainment. And is responsible for capturing an unfathomable amount of footage that, collectively, has garnered billions of views on the Internet. Thats amazing since the point of owning a dash cam is far different. Most people are more interested in the legal and safety benefits of driving with a dash cam than online entertainment royalties.

Depreciation can be a beautiful thingespecially when it means you can get behind the wheel of a big-dollar car on the relative cheap. Below, well look at 10 cars, with many originally priced for folks with money to burn, but which are available today for a steal.

Quite the contrary, actually. In fact, this Cayman S is proof that things are going to be just fine. While electrons are being added to everything from minivans to McLarens, theres no cumbersome hybrid powertrain to clutter up the car with extra weight. Instead, this things all motor  albeit a much smaller one than before. But that counts for something in an era hell-bent on hybridization. Glossing right over the base version and its 2.0-liter turbo engine, this Cayman S still brings the goods. Almost a liter of displacement has been taken out of the engine this time around, not to mention two cylinders, leaving the Cayman S with a mere 2.5-liter flat four to do the job. In the tug of war between driving enjoyment and environmental responsibility, tiny turbo engines are the compromise enthusiasts must live with.

As these recent spy photos show, it looks like the GT4 is coming back now that Porsche is done tinkering with the 911 GT3. While the Cayman was recently given a turbocharged flat-four engine (along with a new numerical name: 718) its likely that the high-speed editions of the mid-engined coupe will remain naturally aspirated. As always, a manual transmission will likely be the only one available. While the last Cayman GT4 used a 3.8-liter flat six, some rumors are saying this model will sport a bigger engine like the 4.0-liter six-cylinder used in the 911 GT3. Itll have to be detuned in this model so it doesnt encroach on the 911s territory, but expect it to make more than the 385 hp that the previous GT4 model had. If you need more proof that a new engine is in the works, the shoddy exhaust setup in this mule makes it seem the automaker is testing something different. Porsche is also working on the vehicles suspension, as the car is sporting foam in the wheel arches and looks unusually wide for a Cayman. And what better place to test a new lightweight mid-engined sports car than the world famous Nurburgring? Sports car fanatics went nuts for the previous lightweight GT4 and it sold out completely, so a new one will likely be just as popular. While a few questions remain, the most important ones are: when do we get one, and will it end up being called a GT4 or a GT4 RS?
