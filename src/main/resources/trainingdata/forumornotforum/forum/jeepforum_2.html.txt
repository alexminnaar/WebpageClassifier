I have a superchip F4 programmer but it doesnt have this functionality. Is there a way to bypass this?

You could hard wire it the same way the guys who are using the connectable on non rubi models. That would leave no way for confirmation and the OEM light will remain flashing AND when you are actually disconnected it will confuse the bejesus outta the stability system - expect heat and wear increase at the brakes, and may even engage more/less brake than you want in technical stuff... (remember - 4lo disengages - or more precisely, runs a modified - esc to disregard roll and sway mitigation). Only other way is disconnectable links - and then again the ESC will not be happy.

But again - no confirmation light, no failure notice light and ESC will NOT expect the excess body roll or sway (please note - they are different motions) at 35mph in 4hi so will be getting after the brakes for correction more often and harder!

Rubicrawler User Profile   Join Date: Feb 2009 Location: Union Posts: 1,285  Profile  Gallery  Classifieds  My Jeeps Garage propped1's Garage 2007 Jeep JK The cool part about the Evo with the switch, is it can be air or electric. I'd imagine with electric the sensor could still work.... although plenty of friends with Rubis where it says it is discoed and isnt. Says it isnt but is. There is a video someplace showing the EVO mechanism and you switch it off and it just drops instantly. had it at 90 degree angle. While still at 90, they flipped switch and then moved the bar up to level and it caught. So really, once you decide to reengage, once you get on level ground, it will find its home. But sure.... no indicator light. I'm assuming that the line is pressurized when discoed and not pressurized when connected. The issue I could foresee is if you had an issue with the air line while wheeling, it would reengage. Couldnt disco... any body know how they would solve this problem? Any kind of manual mechanism? A pull pin on a spring that could lock in place is probably the most fail safe. ._______ /_l__[___], l--|--|--L-OlllllllO] (o)_) (o)_)o-)_) propped1 is online now   Quote Quick Reply propped1 View Public Profile Find More Posts by propped1 post #7 of 9 Unread 07-19-2017, 01:44 PM Kruzin Web Wheeler   2009 JK Wrangler   My Specs Engine: 3.8 Transmission: Auto Transfer Case: 241OR Front Axle: Rubicon D44 Rear Axle: Rubicon D44 Axle Gear Ratio: 4.10 Suspension: 2.5" RE spring lift, Bilstein 9100s, Teraflex adjustable LCAs and track bar Tires: 35" BFG AT-KO Wheels: Fuel 17" Recovery: Warn 10k lb winch, D-rings Armor: Fab Fours bumpers and tire carrier, custom rock rails Accessories: ARB HO under-hood OBA Future Mods: ...?
