Top 10 Overlooked Maintenance Items Jul 17, 2017 - 2:43 PM - by Motorcycle.com Quote: Perhaps the motorcycle manufacturers are to blame. Theyve made their products so reliable that we take them for granted. We almost feel that if we just keep our bikes tank full and spoon new rubber on the rims when necessary, weve got our machinery handled. Well, thats not quite true, and consequently, many riders tend to overlook basic maintenance for extended periods. While lots of riders have the off-season in which they have the time away from riding to take care of annual upkeep, many little things need to be done on a regular basis throughout the riding season.

Jul 13, 2017 - 2:38 PM - by Motorcycle.com Quote: 'Loud pipes save lives' and 'the louder it is the faster it is' are all phrases youve probably heard before, but for a lot of people  particularly the non-riding public  loud exhausts prove to be obnoxious. Which camp do you find yourself in?

Isnt it hard work that usually involves at least one bleeding knuckle? Dont the tools cost a small fortune when you consider that shops only charge about 25 bucks for the service? Well, some riders dont live within a few miles of a bike shop. And some folks, well, theyve always got to do things themselves. The good news is that, overworked sweat glands aside, changing tires is relatively easy  once you have the right tools. All you really need is a bead breaker, a set of tire irons, some dish soap, and a tire balancing stand. Begin with your bike on front and rear stands. Once youve removed a wheel, unscrew the valve core with a valve stem tool. After the tire has finished its lengthy sigh, place your wheel on an old tire or other work surface. Whatever support you use, you want to make sure the wheel is not resting on a brake disc while youre working on the bead. Discs bend all too easily and are quite expensive.
