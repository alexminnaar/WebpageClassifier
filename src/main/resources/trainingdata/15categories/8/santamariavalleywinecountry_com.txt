Nevertheless, they do not have the only quality vineyards in the state. The wines from the younger southern California wineries are on an equal par to their cousins of the north.The bulk of southern California wine is produced in two locations, the vineyards of Santa Barbara, 100 miles north of Los Angeles, and those close to San Diego, 100 miles south of the city. Both areas have been deeply associated with the growth of the California wine industry, a market that now ships over 450 million gallons of wine a year to the US and other countries. Santa Barbara’s Vineyards. The costal mountains east-west placing produces the valleys that open onto the Pacific Ocean. The flow of fog and breezes that result from this bit of serendipitous location produce the perfect conditions for the world-class ranges of wine that are the pride of Santa Barbara. The moderate environment produces the most beneficial conditions that grapes require for optimal sugar and acid levels. There are also several “micro-climates” near the Pacific Coast and the Pala Mesa mountains. The fifty mile coast from Point Conception to Rincon forms the longest east-west coastline on the west coast. The vines here grow on anything and whatever, from the rolling hillsides to the exceptionally warm valleys, where summer season temperatures often reach 100F or 38C. This climate allows the vintners to work throughout the 4 seasons: the pruning and weeding is done throughout the winter season, brand-new planting starts in the spring, canopy management in the summertime and lastly the yearly harvest in the fall. This location has a similar climate to the Rhône valley in France, and the wine makers have actually responded similarly. One specific vineyard is situated on a hillside 1,000 feet above water level, with ideal northern exposure making it the ideal place for the Rhone varietals that are grown here.There are an abundance of European grapes: Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Sangiovese and Syrah. This variety is made possible by the a great deal of micro-climates in the region. For example, the cool-climate Chardonnay succeeds due to the fact that of the occasional snow on the mountains. In contrast, the heat-loving Syrah flourishes in the warmer micro-climates. The wine makers likewise handled the vibrant challenge of growing the challenging Pinot Noir, a wine resonant with strawberry and herbal aspects.While there were almost no vineyards in the county twenty-five years ago, today the wine industry is a $100 million dollar service.
