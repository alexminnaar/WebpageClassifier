It makes me happy to try and coordinate outfits and table-setting around a theme. Last year, we had fun combining two hot trends: floral and gingham. The gingham tablecloth from my daughter’s 14th camp/dance birthday party worked perfectly as a backdrop for all of my florals, which included a real garden rose centerpiece picked from our friends’ beautiful rose garden. I had also been wanting to try some of the buttercream rose piping techniques I had seen on-line so we made these little rose cupcakes for dessert and had fun making this mini-tiered cake with my daughters. The trick is to pipe the roses on to wax paper and let them harden before transferring to the cake. Then you can add leaves. I am in love with beautiful paper plates. They answer the age old question of fancy vs. convenience. And these ones are so pretty, that people didn’t believe they were paper until they touched them. It took me a while to hunt them down. I am including affiliate links at the bottom of this post to save you some time, if you love them as much as I do. And since the love is in the details, these floral straws tied everything together perfectly. Here is our obligatory family Easter picture. There was supposed to be a little more gingham to go with our floral, but son #2 couldn’t find his cool blue gingham shirt that day. But they still clean up pretty well. Who else still tries to coordinate their family’s outfits for special occasions?   For your convenience, here are affiliate links to some of the items I purchased for this occasion: Truly Scrumptious Tea Party Plates Truly Scrumptious Floral Plates Floral Napkins floral straws Blue Gingham Tablecloth (not the one I used, but looks nice).

Sadly my computer crashed shortly there after and I lost the photos, but I still wanted to share our menu and set-up ideas. We had a gourmet-style menu, with a dessert buffet and Hot Cider Bar.

I know! How about ice cold, fresh, homemade lemon ice cream? My husband's family has a long held tradition of making lemon ice cream when the temperatures rise. He made it for me when we were dating. It might just be one of the reasons we got married. The other day he got a hankering (probably inspired by the fact that I cleaned out the pantry and now the ice cream maker was in plain sight), and made a batch. He has doctored up the recipe a little from what his family did originally. But the end result is absolutely delish! I posted a picture and some commentary on Instagram and based on the response, decided I'd better share the recipe here, with his permission, of course. The recipe I'm sharing is BSB's version. The original did not include yogurt, used heavy cream, and not quite so much lemon juice. So there is room for … [Read the rest of the Insanity...] Wooden Father’s Day Tie Banner June 9, 2016 By kendra Leave a Comment Many years ago, I created a Father's Day banner out of paper ties. I have loved this banner and used it repeatedly, but it has become apparent that making the banner out of a different material would transform it into something that could withstand the years! Here is my wooden version of the Father's Day Tie banner! This is a fun project for a craft night or to do with the kids. You could give each kid their own tie to paint. You could add letters to spell something--I had originally planned to on these--or you could just let the ties do the talking--which is what I decided to do, since I loved the way the patterned ties look hanging together. You also have the options to leave some the wood exposed--like I did on the striped ties--for a more rustic look, or paint each tie entirely--like I did on the polka dots. But before we get too carried away designing the banner, we should make sure we know what … [Read the rest of the Insanity...] Cinco en mayo — A Cinco de Mayo Birthday Party for Kids May 2, 2016 By kendra Leave a Comment Hola! My son has a May Day birthday, but rather than maypoles and flowers, I thought it would be really fun to have a Cinco de Mayo party for him, especially when he turned five. I called it a Cinco en Mayo party, because that means "5 in May!" Yes, I admit this theme was all my idea. I don't know that many five-year-olds would know to ask for a Cinco de mayo fiesta for their birthdays. And it was a little bit of a tough sell at first to talk him out of things like robots and transformers, but once I started talking about how this would be his Piñata party, he got pretty excited. This kid loves Piñatas--and the candy that comes inside of them! So true to my word, Piñatas were a main feature everywhere.  There is a little piñata on and some of the other recurrent themes I sent out these digital invitations I made with elements from Happy Thought. Mini Piñatas decorated our tables and went … [Read the rest of the Insanity...] Modern Garden Floral Arrangement April 20, 2016 By kendra Leave a Comment Last Spring my daughter and I were honored to be asked to put together a large-scale floral arrangement to be displayed at the pulpit of our church for an important meeting. We were given a modest budget and instructions that it would be on a shallow shelf, so the arrangement couldn't be too deep. Other than that, we were pretty much on our own to design and put together whatever we chose. I have really been loving the more natural garden-like trends I am seeing a lot in modern floral arrangements. I wanted to use garden roses and other large blooms in spring colors. I used to do flowers all of the time, but things have changed quite a bit in the last decade or so. I first had to find a place to get wholesale bunches of flowers that is open to the public. The guys at Arizona Flower Market were great to work with (This is not a sponsored post. I just wanted to share their info because I know others … [Read the rest of the Insanity...] Older Posts About Find It Button Find the Insanity: Insanity by TopicInsanity by Topic Select Category #CleverRobot  (1) #spon  (9) 4th of July  (10) advertising  (6) anniversary  (8) April Fools  (5) Autumn  (11) awards  (9) babies  (47) baking  (12) beauty  (2) birthdays  (113) blogging  (24) blogiversary  (8) boys’ birthdays  (56) by request  (1) cake  (86) camp  (8) cards  (36) carnival  (2) causes  (7) Chinese New Year  (1) Christmas  (81) circus  (2) contests  (16) cookies  (19) costumes  (23) crafts  (49) cupcakes  (16) date night  (10) digital scrapbooking  (15) downloads  (6) Easter  (29) election  (3) families  (16) family reunion  (9) fathers day  (21) favorite things  (2) flashback friday  (6) flowers  (22) food  (87) football  (4) gift-wrapping  (3) gifts  (102) girl birthdays  (46) girls night out  (11) giveaway  (65) goals  (5) gourmet group  (17) graduation  (5) Great Gift Guide  (6) guest blogger  (18) Halloween  (56) home decor  (74) homekeeping  (6) hybrid  (6) ice cream  (2) Insanity  (3) inspired by My Insanity  (3) invitations  (50) kids  (188) LDS  (6) Linky party  (5) makeover  (32) mantle  (10) May Day  (1) mothers day  (14) movies  (3) Mr. Linky  (25) music  (8) New Years  (27) olympics  (3) organization  (21) paint  (12) parties  (173) Party Party  (9) patriotic parties  (14) photography  (28) pirates  (4) preparedness  (1) preschool  (5) primary  (8) printable  (29) projects  (56) recipe  (12) review  (10) robot  (3) school  (38) scrapbooking  (6) sewing  (20) shopping  (7) showers  (20) Silhouette  (9) Snap the conference  (4) spa day  (9) space  (7) sponsors  (17) Spring  (18) St. Patrick’s Day  (10) style  (12) summer  (18) tablescapes  (57) thank you  (7) Thanksgiving  (39) travel  (12) Trina  (7) TV  (3) Uncategorized  (72) Valentines  (44) video  (4) vinyl  (3) wedding  (13) winter  (20) wrapping  (3) Insanity Past Insanity Past Select Month February 2017 November 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 June 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 <a href="http://www.meandmyinsanity.com/"><img src="http://meandmyinsanity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wp-button.png"/></a> There are no days in life so MEMORABLE as those which vibrated to some stroke of the IMAGINATION. * Ralph Waldo Emmerson Today’s Top 10 Insanity Fool’s Cafe – A Surprise Dinner Tradition Colorful Office Chair Makeover Under the Sea Mermaid Birthday Party Mad Science Birthday Disneyland Travel Kits Primary Ice Cream Social ("Get the Scoop on your… How to make a 3D Train Cake Superhero Birthday for Kids Spa Day Birthday “Perfect 10” Disney FROZEN Winter Party Instant Insanity More Insanity About… #disneyside #fneasy Back to school best of birthday Birthday party book club birthday book party cake Christmas Christmas cards costumes craft crafts decor decorations disney DIY family costumes fashion fathers day gift favors food gifts giveaway Great Gift Guide 2012 Halloween invitations LDS Nancy Drew New Year's Eve party party party photography printable printables recipe school treats school valentines SNAP! tablescape teacher appreciation thanksgiving Thanksgiving table vintage Disclosure Policy 5 Insane people say… Petite Blog on Superhero Birthday for Kids vyrába a distribuuje on Book Club Birthday–Prologue Shellie on Fresh Rosemary Wreath for Christmas Dinner SEO Grantham on A Tangled Celebration Thank Blog on The Fairy Party Subscribe to My Insanity via Email Enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.
