I mean, really really sucks. The snowfall total was an inch until the day we left town (as of January 22nd, 2016). Then it started snowing and eventually 31 inches came down. Thankfully we were able to escape the storm within hours and flew out. Otherwise we would’ve been grounded and wasted first few days of our annual trip to the west. No direct flight to Jackson, so connected in Chicago and finally Jackson, Wyoming. Heard it's very difficult to get in and out, but it wasn't all that bad. In fact, the airport was much nicer than Vail or Aspen. Packed up the rental car and 20 minutes later finally arrived in Teton Village. Our hotel was ski in/out right by the lift and gondola. First meal in Jackson at Spur. Had to try Bison Bone-in Ribeye. The mountain was beautiful, intimidating, fun and scary. Way, way more than I could ever ask for! Infamous Corbet's Couloir. Not that I was gonna go down, it was closed. Argo, CassMT and kalev like this.

That was already 5th fatality this season. There was a tree well incident a month prior. Best picture from Jackson. Kids were done. lol Motogp990 and XxGoGirlxX like this.

We were stuck in the village for 5 days just skiing/snowboarding. Everybody's mama saw moose. But moose are unicorns to me. They don't exist. Next off, Aspen. Can see the X Games superpipe lights from Buttermilk. Practice was going on. Aspen Highlands. Kiddos got adventurous. lol Finally X Games! Levi LaVallee's sled. Too bad he got hurt and couldn't compete snowmobile freestyle.

Nas and Twenty One Pilots were amazing.

I should bring dog treats in my pocket in case I need to be rescued from avalanche. Was able to squeeze in some rides here and there. Aspen Mountain. Buttermilk. Back to X Games. Superpipe on the left, big air on the right. It is a beautiful site. We were there as ESPN guests with VIP access. So I got to meet a lot of pros.

Kelly Clark Chloe Kim signing my helmet. Got to touch X Games gold medal! X Games over, back to riding. Snowmass greets me with 44 inch fresh snow.

Got trapped in deep snow couple times and had to dig myself out. Too bad didn't get to check out Cirque. Avalanche cannon control was going off non stop. Denver airport before Super Bowl. Farewell big mountains, back to the city lights! Well, at least until next season. Can't wait to go back!! Davichin likes this.
