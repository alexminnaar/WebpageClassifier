Memories from Ooty Trip Wednesday, May 11th, 2011 This is one of the video from our wonder trip of ooty. Little back ground story, we had a special character in our group, Nasrin. Most notorious and irritating many times ;). She has some in built battery that gets discharge too fast but easy to charge back if she gets plateful of rice. Before this video was taken, she was half dead, not able to walk on her own. Just watch how her facial expression changes with each grain of rice going in her mouth 😀 Filed in Trip/Places | Tagged friends, ooty, video | Permalink | Comments (0) Adieu to 2010 and Welcome to 2011 Friday, December 31st, 2010 2010 was the year that came with lots of different colors – Some dark and some bright. This year, many friend left Hyderabad for good, but then I also made lots of new good friends. 🙂 This year was full of roller coaster experience for me. First started with a failure of entrepreneurial adventure then abandonment of second adventure, but then some return of success from third one. Trekking to Tapovan was the most mesmerizing experience I had this year.It is the place where you really meet yourself, can understand your existence and relation with the world around you. The departing year has given me a lot of things to carry forward, and I would love to thank 2010 for it. I am also looking forward to 2011 with lots more excitement to happen. I usually don’t like making  resolution but I will carry forward the same resolution, I made sometime back that I will do more stuff than just wishing for them. Welcome 2011! I am waiting for you 🙂 Few Snapshots of 2010: New Year 2010 Trip to Home (Himachal) The Light @ IIT Kanpur From Tadianmol_Trekking From Badrinath Trip with Family From Ajantha Trip From Tapovan Filed in Uncategorized | | Permalink | Comments (2) Kya Vishal Bhardwaj Bhi Chor Hain?

Though she was not able to complete it. I am posting the entire poem – Thanks Aahana 🙂 Main aur meri tanhaai aksar yeh baatein karte hain Tum hoti to kaisa hota, tum yeh kehti, tum voh kehti Tum is baat pe hairaan hoti, tum us baat pe kitni hansti Tum hoti to aisa hota, tum hoti to vaisa hota Main aur meri tanhaai aksar yeh baatein karte hain Yeh kahan aa gaye hum Yunhi saath saath chalte Teri baahon mein hai jaanam Mere jism-o-jaan pighalte Yeh kahan aa gaye hum Yunhi saath saath chalte Yeh raat hai, yeh tumhaari zulfein khuli hui hai Hai chaandni ya tumhaari nazrein se meri raatein dhuli hui hai Yeh chaand hai ya tumhaara kangan Sitaarein hai ya tumhaara aanchal Hawa ka jhonka hai ya tumhaare badan ki khushboo Yeh pattiyon ki hai sarsaraahat ke tumne chupke se kuch kaha hai Yeh sochta hoon main kab se gumsum Ke jab ki mujhko bhi yeh khabar hai Ke tum nahin ho, kahin nahin ho Magar yeh dil hai ke keh raha hai Ke tum yahin ho, yahin kahin ho O, tu badan hai main hoon chhaaya Tu na ho to main kahan hoon Mujhe pyaar karne waale Tu jahan hai main vahan hoon Hamein milna hi tha hamdam Issi raah pe nikalte Yeh kahan aa gaye hum Yunhi saath saath chalte Mm, meri saans saans maheke Koi bheena bheena chandan Tera pyaar chaandni hai Mera dil hai jaise aangan Koi aur bhi mulaayam Meri shaam dhalte dhalte Yeh kahan aa gaye hum Yunhi saath saath chalte Majboor yeh haalaat, idhar bhi hai udhar bhi Tanhaai ki ek raat, idhar bhi hai udhar bhi Kehne ko bahut kuch hai, magar kisse kahe hum Kab tak yunhi khaamosh rahe aur sahe hum Dil kehta hai duniya ki har ek rasm utha de Deevaar jo hum dono mein hai, aaj gira den Kyoon dil mein sulagte rahe, logon ko bata de Haan humko mohabbat hai, mohabbat hai, mohabbat Ab dil mein yehi baat, idhar bhi hai udhar bhi Yeh kahan aa gaye hum Yunhi saath saath chalte Yeh kahan aa gaye hum Filed in Misc, Poem | Tagged friend, poem, shayari | Permalink | Comments (1) < Older posts Subscribe myBlogs!
