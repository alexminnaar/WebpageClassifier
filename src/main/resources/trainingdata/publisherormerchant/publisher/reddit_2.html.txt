Is there any kind of metric available, that would actually confirm that claim? I found this on arXiv, but I'm not quite sure as how to interpret it (if it's even relevant). I'm mostly looking for some kind of measured growth of papers submissions compared to other areas, as I think that would be an interesting metric. 2 comments share report all 2 comments sorted by: best topnewcontroversialoldrandomq&alive (beta) [–]Mandrathax 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (1 child) Check the evolution of number of citations for seminal neural net papers.
