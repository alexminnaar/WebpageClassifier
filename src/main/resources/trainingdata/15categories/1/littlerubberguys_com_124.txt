Mega Man X3 Keshi and Gumball for Trade Started by deadfishlake , Yesterday, 04:30 AM Please log in to reply No replies to this topic #1 deadfishlake deadfishlake Gimme everything you got! Members 361 posts Gender:Male Location:Northern Illinois Posted Yesterday, 04:30 AM Hey all, I have a small number of MMX2 and X3 Keshi and gumball figures I'd like to trade.  Mostly looking for hard Bad Eggz Bunch.  All are complete and in good condition.  I'd offer ALL the keshi for 1 Bad Eggz, or 2 of the gumballs for 1 Bad Eggz.    I have good but old feedback here, and recent feedback elsewhere.  All positive.  Shipping comes from northern Illinois.  Let me know if you're interested, thanks!
