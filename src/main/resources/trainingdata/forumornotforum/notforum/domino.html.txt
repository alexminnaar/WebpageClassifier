Compliment your golden tan with the perfect accessory to keep the sun under control: the Alaparagatas Hat. Made from ultra-flexible woven raffia, the Alparagatas Hat has a bucket crown that sits slightly higher on the head than a conventionally fitting hat. Knot the ribbon under your left ear for a chic touch, or just let the hat hang nonchalantly down your back like a 40's senorita! This hat adds a rustic flare to any outfit whether its on the beach in your cutest bikini and sarong or walking through Central Park in a sundress. This hat is the must have item of your closet this year.  This hat is what we like to call sandy chic; accessories that are as perfect for the beach as they are for an afternoon happy hour or an evening stroll through the city. Anytime the sun beats down a little too hard, but you don't want to sacrifice your stellar look, just slip into this sandy chic hat and bring the beach with you.
