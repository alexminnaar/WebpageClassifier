Follow us on Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Feed Patent: Variable Curved Image Sensor Concept By Canon Rumors | August 18, 2017 | Canon Patents Northlight Images has uncovered a patent showing some curved sensor technology. The interesting part of this patent, is that the level of curvature in the sensor changes depending on the focal length. You can see in the image above that there is a piston like device that will change the curve of the sensor. As pointed out by Northlight, a “flat” setting is included here as well, so there should be no compatibility issues with old or third party lenses.   28 comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Via: Northlight Images Source: J PlatPat Firmware: Sigma Updates the Brand New 24-70mm f/2.8 DG OS HSM Art.

The original SL1 was slow to gain acceptance, but once it did, it became a favourite among professional, prosumer and consumer DSLR buyers. From TDP: I know, you’ve been wanting to ask the question since hearing the model name of this camera. What does the “SL” in the SL2 model name mean? Canon’s official answer is: “It doesn’t have a meaning”. I hate to leave you disappointed, so … consider SL to mean “Small” and “Light” as those are hallmarks of this camera. The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 / 200D is a small and light camera that is easy to take with you everywhere. If you always have a camera available, you are going to get images that were not otherwise possible. And getting an image in the first place is always an advantage. Still, this camera does not make you give up the features and image quality you love. You get a comfortable-to-use grip that is adequately-sized to provide solid control of the camera. You get a TTL optical viewfinder and fast phase-detection AF along with the excellent Dual Pixel AF system that performs extremely well including during video capture.
