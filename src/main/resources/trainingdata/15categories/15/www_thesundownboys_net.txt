Recently I've been really dissatisfied with my coloring, both when it comes to how long it takes and the finished product. I found myself dreading the coloring stage of every page, and I felt that it was taking away from the quality of the comic, rather than adding to it. So, for the time being, I'm switching over to B&W and I'll be experimenting in the coming pages with different techniques in order to find the right fit. I've always thought my line art was good enough to stand on its own, and I hope that's true. Most of my experimentation will be when it comes to shading in B&W. I hope this doesn't bother any of you or take away from the experience. I want to put out good pages for you guys and I just felt that my coloring skills were taking away from the overall product. Please keep reading my comic! :P In the meantime, I'll continue to color illustrations and practice landscapes so that some day soon TSDB can return to color. I think I just need more time to get my skills to a more acceptable level. Thanks for your support and I'll see you next week!
