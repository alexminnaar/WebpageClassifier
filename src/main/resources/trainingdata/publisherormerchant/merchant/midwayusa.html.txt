Product Information {{getProductMessage()}} Overview Specifications Videos (1) Reviews (348) Delivery Info Overview The RCBS ChargeMaster Combo takes the accurate ChargeMaster Scale and Charge Master Dispenser and combines them into one unit. No longer do reloaders have to calibrate their dispensers to the type of powder being dispensed. Type in the charge weight and hit dispenses and that is all that is needed. The layout of the unit gives reloaders easy access to the scale pan by either right or left handed reloaders and the clear cover helps to eliminate fluctuations in weighting caused by air currents without obscuring the view of the powder being dispensed. Technical Information: Accuracy: +/- 1/10 grain Features: Measures in both grains or grams Average dispensing time of 60 grains of extruded powder is 30 seconds Stores up to 30 loads for fast recall Powder Drain Feature 4-Speed Motorized powder trickler Capacity: 1 Pound Includes: Powder Drain Feature, 2 check weights, AC adapter Charge Weight: 2-300 grains (Not for Black Powder) Voltage: 110 Volt Warranty: Limited 1-year warranty Notes: For Smokeless Powder Only (Will not work with Black Powder) Specifications {{attribute.name}} {{attribute.value[0]}} {{attribute.value[0]}} {{attribute.value}} Search for {{attribute.name}} No {{attribute.name}}s match your search. {{values}} {{values}} {{showAll && 'Show Fewer' || 'Show All ' + attribute.value.length }} Compatible With {{compatibleWithAttribute.name}} {{compatibleWithAttribute.values[0]}} {{formatFilterOptionNameForDisplay(value)}} Videos (1) Product Videos RCBS Video Reviews (348) The statements and opinions expressed within Customer Reviews reflect each author's personal perspective and do not imply endorsement by MidwayUSA, its Employees or any other organization.
