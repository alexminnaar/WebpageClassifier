Morgan is based in Malvern Link, Worcestershire and employs 163 people. Morgan produced 640 cars in 2007. All the cars are assembled by hand. The waiting list for a car is approximately one to two years, although it has been as high as ten years in the past. Morgans are a low production luxury sportscar, hand-built using traditional methods. The Morgan car has always been built around an ash frame, and a steel chassis. The new Aero 8 also has an ash frame. In spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had "sports car" performance, due to their extremely low weight. Many Morgans have been imported in the USA, Canada, and other foreign markets due to their unique design and uncompromising quality.
