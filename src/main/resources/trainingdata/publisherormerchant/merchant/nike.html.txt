DURABLE AND STABLE The fully updated Nike Metcon 3 Men's Training Shoe is ready for your most demanding workouts—from wall exercises and rope climbs to sprinting and lifting. Cushioned for Training An updated drop-in midsole is softer and more flexible in the forefoot—providing the versatility you need for running and cardio drills. Stability for Lifting A flat platform and a firm-rubber heel give you the powerful stability you need for explosive lifting. Lightweight and Durable With embroidered reinforcement in high-wear areas, the Metcon 3 is tough enough for intense training and light enough to help you stay fast on your feet. More Details Flywire cables offer powerful lockdown Mesh on the heel and ankle help keep you cool Heel clip helps reduce drag during wall exercises Sticky rubber in the forefoot provides powerful traction Textured rubber wraps up the midfoot for durability during rope exercises Nike Metcon 3 Men's Training Shoe CUSTOMER REVIEWS 5 Never Had A Doubt Written By zende017 06/15/2017 After continually buying older styles of shoes for the weight room I finally managed to pay the extra money for the superior product in getting these. I work out 6-7 days a week doing a variety of Olympic lifts and plyometrics. These blow my old Zoom Trainer series out of the water in regards to the squats, cleans, etc., providing a solid and stable foundation. They still are able to move swiftly through the speed ladders, box jumps, and plyometric fun due to the lightness of them as well. I haven't run in them yet, I have a pair of Frees for sprint work, but if you need a shoe for the weight room and any bootcamp-esque training, these are what you need. 5 Best Metcon Yet Written By WVCOASTIE Morgantown, WV, USA 06/09/2017 Best Metcon Yet! I have owned all the Metcons and these are by far the best. Lighter, more flexible, and way more comfortable! You need these! RWB!! 5 Metcon for life Written By saytan66 Oxnard ca 06/08/2017 Love the show.... have no complaints from the metcon1 to the 3 ... I wear mine in and out of the box and its a daily work shoe too 5 The only shoe I wear Written By T-1 Santa Barbara, CA, USA 06/07/2017 First of all, love this CW, and I start the review this way because I own a lot of metcons. Overall the 3 is a great shoe, the new updates really improved the feel and comfort compared to the 2's. Shoe is light weight and super stable, and is great for most training. I have read some of the negative reviews and will say this is not a running shoe, or a training shoe for someone that is looking for a lot of cushion. These are very different compared to the free run family, or any other shoe nike offers. There is essentially no midsole cushion as all, the cushion comes from the insole, so if you are use to a softer shoe that moves on you foot these will feel very different. Now I gave the great for most training as they are not ideal for running long distances, although you can run in them, but it takes getting use to as the cushioning is very different and the heel to toe drop is way different then normal running shoes. Anything in the gym these are excellent for as they are stable, flat, and light. For me I love the metcons, and they are the only shoe I wear literally, wear them everyday to work and to workout in. So I think nike has done a great job with this shoe, but like I stated previously they are not for everyone and if you are use to a cushioned shoe these may not be for you, but all around a fantastic shoe in my mind. 5 Best Shoe at the Box Written By Mr.Snuffleupagus Pasadena, CA, USA 05/11/2017 I've had these shoes since the beginning of March and have used them 6 days a week doing WODs, bootcamp classes, and even runs and they've been amazing. Stability during lifts have been great but still have enough cushion to run in. I am not kind to my shoes and treat them more like equipment and they've held up perfectly with just normal wear and tear. I would definitely recommend and I am looking forward to the METCON 4!
