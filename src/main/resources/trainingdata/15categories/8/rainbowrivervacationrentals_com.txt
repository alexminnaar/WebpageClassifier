Rainbow River Vacation Rentals - Vacation Homes, Ocala, Florida USA Rainbow River Vacation Rentals - Vacation Homes, Ocala, Florida USA ↓ Skip to Main Content Menu Welcome to Rainbow River Vacation Rentals Great Place to Stay on a Beautiful River The Rainbow River can be found in Dunnellon, FL, about 100 miles from both Orlando and Tampa. The river gets it's name from the colorful water. There is a steady current so you can float, swim, canoe, snorkel, or scuba dive down the river letting the current move you along or stroll on the walking paths to enjoy the many plants and animals. It is literally like swimming in a freshwater aquarium. “One of the BEST places to go if you want to experience the REAL FLORIDA!” There is just something incredibly special when you feel that you "discover" someplace "new"...for me this was the Rainbow River. This is a lovely slice of Old Florida. The Springs are a natural attraction that feed the Rainbow River giving you one of the few opportunities to swim in crystal clear blue water in a natural environment. “Beautiful, just Beautiful - Don't Miss It!” Reservations and Availability >> Rainbow River . .
