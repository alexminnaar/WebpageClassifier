I'm considering folding a small release into March's Ironhaus release.

At least it wasn't still shelfwarming there (forget where else it was). 0 Baltan II's LRG Want List - Hunting for my final MUSCLE, Red 131 Ukon, Gormiti, Jagun Fighters, and more!  My Sale/Trade Thread!

I guess every single Strange Monsters release in green (all sold out everywhere I think?), rather than a second solid color I'd be super into something in a marble color, that would look amazing and complementary next to either of the Tug-o-Wars that I did get.   The number one idea that comes to mind is, naturally, Hedorah. Whether based on the original movie appearance in a toxic gray with hints of green and yellow, the Final Wars version that also splashed in some purples, or any of the ridiculous vintage Bullmark figure colors, I think that'd be swell. Really link together one pollution monster to another.   Yeah, I don't buy toys like I once did, but that would be a hell of a way to tempt me into a purchase. 1 Baltan II's LRG Want List - Hunting for my final MUSCLE, Red 131 Ukon, Gormiti, Jagun Fighters, and more!  My Sale/Trade Thread!

Tugs kept disappearing insanely fast while, tragically in my opinion, Necrolossus seemed to stick around. Of course, when I look again in 2017, big ol' nope, all gone from Eric and Jon. I was wrong on another figure though, Shogunasty does at least persist. 0 Baltan II's LRG Want List - Hunting for my final MUSCLE, Red 131 Ukon, Gormiti, Jagun Fighters, and more!  My Sale/Trade Thread!
