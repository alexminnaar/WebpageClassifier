Home – Mark Railton Mark Railton Home Blog Hi there, I'm Mark! I'm a software developer working primarily on web applications using various languages including PHP, node.js and Python. In 2016 I obtained the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development from Edinburgh Napier University which focuses on full stack development using AngularJS on the front-end and Python by way of django and flask on the back-end. After completing the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development I was brought back as a mentor for the online version of their course and through that have discovered a passion in helping other developers getting a start in the development industry. I'm also a volunteer with Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) and do what I can to help spread the word in the tech community that it's ok to not always be ok. By day I work as a software developer for Transpoco further developing the Synx platform. Outside of work in addition to being a mentor for Code Institute and volunteering with OSMI, I enjoy target archery and photography using both a digital SLR camera as well as with my DJI drone. When time permits I like to contribute to opensource projects, namely joind.in as well as researching new technologies to try and stay ahead of the ever evolving world of web development, you may even see some of these newer technologies being used on this site as I get to grips with them.
