Drive" is rated 4.7 out of 5 by 23. Rated 4 out of 5 by Rays31 from tools and tool bag This is very handy to keep in my truck. Holds a good amount of tools above what comes in the kit. The included tools are of decent quality. They are not used everyday but handy when needed. Date published: 2017-03-02 Rated 5 out of 5 by Officehelp from Little Bag of Tools This is just the set to have around the office for those little jobs you can't get the guys to pull out the big tools for. No, it is not a professional set that can handle heavy duty repairs, but if you have a small job, it has about any tool you might need with this set of 70 items in it. I looked around at other sets and this one had the most assortment of tools for the comparable price. I needed something around here besides two little shorty screwdrivers. Date published: 2017-02-14 Rated 5 out of 5 by kent56 from Great under desk tool set. Great. All inclusive "grab and run" tool set for small "on the run" repair and assembly job. Strong tools, great carry bag, contains "all the right tools" for most jobs. Date published: 2017-01-26 Rated 4 out of 5 by PopDude from Grandson gift Got this for my grandson for Christmas, who is moving into a new house in the spring. It has everything you need for repairs to putting together furniture kits. I gave it four stars because the only thing not included were channel locks. For this price, though, who could ask for anything more. My grandson loved it. Date published: 2017-01-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by LOVEANDLUCK from AMAZING!!! This is the best tool set I have ever bought!! The quality and variety of the tools is well worth the money! Date published: 2017-01-04 "Ironton Tool Bag Set - 70-Pc., 1/4in. and 3/8in.
