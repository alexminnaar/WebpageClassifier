What about repaints of the rhino and scorpion?Yep. I for sure want to do that black widow version, the Sailon version, the Scorponok and Rhinox versions. Black-washed bone versions, GITD, etc. A lot of that stuff will show up as add-ons as we go through the month. Whatever doesn't make it into the Kickstarter for those two can happen pretty quickly afterwards though, since the mold is already done for them. 2 LittleRubberGuys Store O.M.F.G.
