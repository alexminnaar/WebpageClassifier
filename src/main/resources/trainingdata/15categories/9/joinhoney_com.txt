Learn More What people say about Honey. Katie Kaczmarek★★★★★Honey literally translates to easy, free money. I thought it was a gimmick at first, since it seemed too good to be true, but when I started online shopping at Target, the add-on automatically popped up and saved me $10 on my first purchase. There is no reason not to add this to your browser. From Chrome Store Greg Bickert★★★★★It's great. Now I don't have to waste my time searching on Google for coupons, entering them one at a time (having most of them fail) and hope that I will get some savings. With Honey, just click the button and let it try the codes for you. So Great! Honey = Money! From Chrome Store Ananda Ellis★★★★★Does all the work for me.
