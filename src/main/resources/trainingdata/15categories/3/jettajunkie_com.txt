Jan 27, 2017 - 1:04 AM - by JerryLtowIt The coolant temp sensor housing on my Mkv Gli has a hairline crack in it. Anything I should be prepared for? I've seen a few threads on and about the sensor itself, but not the housing. It looks pretty straight forward, though the location is not my favorite. ðŸ˜¬ You can barley see fluid seeping. I can't think of how that could've happened. Sent from my... [Read More] Â  Â  2 Replies | 2,249 Views A noob here... Dec 05, 2016 - 10:46 PM - by JerryLtowIt Just wanted to check in and say hello! I purchased my 07 Gli about four months ago from a tow yard I worked at. Someone's bad luck turned out in my favor. I practically stole it for the $1500 I paid. Very clean, inside and out, and I'm finding out the previous owner must've been a Jetta Junkie as well. There are lots of mods this guy did, and probably one of the reasons it was impounded. I'll be posting here and there, anxious to get to know this wonderful car! It's pretty fast. ...

Aug 19, 2017 - 1:32 PM - by yeahhh Hi All, My sons Jetta has a body kit installed..not sure what kind, it was from previous owner. Anyway, the front bumper has started to slide down or droop...the screws are all tight. He was recently in AZ in some pretty extreme temps approx 117...so the highway was probably even hotter. Anyway, it looks like the adhesive or glue used on the front bumper has failed. What kind of glue or adhesive should we use to re-attached the bumper?

I just fixed the misaligned shifter cable so it locks into every gear fine, but usually when I shift it to Drive, it wont leave 1st gear. Sometimes I get lucky and she rolls fine until it's parked & shifted back to Drive. It's not running cold; it's about 88 degrees here & I've even let the car warm up for 10 minutes and tried. No luck. I... [Read More] Â  Â  2 Replies | 56 Views DYNOS: How to read the numbers, understand them and compare it to others - MUST SEE!
