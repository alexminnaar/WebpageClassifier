A huge difference in this draft and with the state of North's list they need as much top end talent as possible. I think they'll be doing their best to drop the game.   bird_man, Aug 20, 2017 at 8:30 PM #1 Reply (Log in to remove this ad.)

Wouldn't that bizarrely make north winning this week a preferable outcome for gc?   StillAtLarge, Aug 20, 2017 at 9:03 PM #7 Reply vide0n, sthmelb_dimmies, tigs2010 and 2 others like this.

My own side (among many others) have tanked football matches in order to better their draft position. It is a part of the game.

Tbh, certain types of tanking are actually entertaining, stuff like throwing players into unfamiliar positions for 'development' can be hilarious in a match like this. I don't think players should or realistically would take part in tanking these days, you never know what will happen in the off-season and you can easily be traded, so why even worry where your current club places in the draft?   MarkCatsFan, Aug 20, 2017 at 9:27 PM #14 Reply Power Raid Hall of Famer Port Adelaide Other teams: Joined: Oct 04 Posts: 43,947 Location: West Perth I think tanking is behind us   Power Raid, Aug 20, 2017 at 9:28 PM #15 Reply Foucault1989 All Australian Carlton Other teams: Joined: Oct 16 Posts: 883 Tanking is in the past.

I expect the Lions will win regardless. Beams to take out The Royal Bastinac medal, assuming he's not in the stands for his Garlett body slam. If we do finish last, at least we will have done it honorably, without tanking, or being sent there due to being drug or salary cap cheats.   Rod Stroker, Aug 20, 2017 at 9:34 PM #17 Reply Page8383 likes this. donbooger Club Legend Geelong Other teams: Joined: Sep 07 Posts: 1,487 Location: werribee I hope not, teams should be ashamed at receiving the spoon.

Even last year with a team full of VFL players and top ups we tried our hardest to avoid the spoon and I was filthy finishing bottom.
