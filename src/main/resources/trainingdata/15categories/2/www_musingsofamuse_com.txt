Clinique Pep-Start Pout Perfecting Balm for Fall 2017 By Isabella Muse on August 21, 2017 1 Comment in Clinique, Fall Collections 2017 Affiliate As if I need another lip balm but I really do want to try Clinique Pep-Start Pout Perfecting Balm. Sorry not sorry! These reminded me of those old NYC Color Cosmetics Apple Lip Balms remember those? Anyway, this Fall Clinique is again extending their Pep-Start Collection with yet another new offering. These moisturizing balms provide deep hydration and provide lips with deeply conditioning moisture that leaves them soft and smooth! You can snag a non-tinted version or choose three different shades to get a dash of color with your moisture. Shades: Guava Tangerine Cherry Clear Clinique Pep-Start Pout Perfecting Balm is $17.50 and available now at sephora.com. Tarte Back to School Tools Brush Set $39 for a Limited Time By Isabella Muse on August 21, 2017 1 Comment in Fall Collections 2017, Tarte Affiliate Tarte Back to School Tools Brush Set ($39) is available for a limited time for the Fall 2017 season and includes 6 essential makeup brushes to create your complete makeup look! I have a mild obsession with back to school supplies! Stationary, new pens, pencils, paper, notepads, I love it all. I’m particularly obsessed with appointment books and diaries. We are all equipped with the latest and greatest technology yet here I am getting all excited about a paper journal. There’s irony here somewhere. This new brush set includes: Double-Ended Eyeshadow Brush Powder Brush Double-Ended Eyeliner Brush Double-Ended Contour & Highlight Brush Foundation Brush Double-Ended Concealer Brush It’s actually a great set if you’re in need of some new brushes but the double-ended brushes might be a turn off for some folks! But the price is just right if you are interested in hauling this one. It’s available for a limited time at tarte.com (Free Shipping on orders $40 or more). Too Faced I Want Kandee for Fall 2017 By Isabella Muse on August 21, 2017 9 Comments in Fall Collections 2017, Too Faced Affiliate The Too Faced I Want Kandee Collection for Fall 2017 arrives exclusively at ulta.com and toofacedcosmetics.com starting September 3rd. This is a collobration makeup collection between youTuber guru, Kandee Johnson, and Too Faced that’s feels like it’s been hinted at for literally ages and finally we’ll be able to get our hands on it in a few short weeks. I already know what I want! Banana Pudding Powder please and thank you! First off, it smells like bananas! Secondly, you can apparently use it under your eyes to brighten them up while setting concealer. I’m sold. Here’s what to expect from the Too Faced I Want Kandee Collection!
