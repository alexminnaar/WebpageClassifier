I snagged a Beastly Boyd the other day. The only potential identifying mark I could find was located on the bottom of the box and it read as follows: DRM161020. Can someone shine any light on this?

If so, I'd love to see someone crack the code on the MadBalls vinyls. 0 Stuff I'm looking for Back to top #3 jason76basin jason76basin Serious Collector Members 740 posts Gender:Male Posted 07 April 2017 - 05:57 AM Gpk is a no, sorry Joel. The madballs minis have a small indention code 1-13 on the back of each package. 0 collection thread http://www.littlerub...sin#entry419886   Back to top #4 MudPuppetJoel MudPuppetJoel Serious Collector Members 206 posts Gender:Male Interests:Battle Beasts, Final Fantasy, Garbage Pail Kids Minikins, Ghostbusters, MIMP, M.U.S.C.L.E, Mutant Mania, OMFG, S.L.U.G Zombies, Socket Poppers, TMNT, Trash Pack, video editing, haunted attractions, hockey, professional wrestling Posted 07 April 2017 - 06:58 AM Gpk is a no, sorry Joel. The madballs minis have a small indention code 1-13 on the back of each package. I thought it was odd that nobody had made a post for either Series 1 or 2 had the codes existed.

Any idea about those? 0 Stuff I'm looking for Back to top #6 jason76basin jason76basin Serious Collector Members 740 posts Gender:Male Posted 07 April 2017 - 12:57 PM Yeah that's what I meant by Gpk is a no. No way to tell those at all. I'm a die hard gpker.
