The only draw back is the elastic for the fitted sheet isn't sewn into the fabric so you have to kind work the gathers around the bed evenly. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Great fit, great feel and Amazing price. Can't go wrong. I got the charcoal gray and they're beautiful. Read More Amber O.

I like the sheets but dislike the way the elastic is only in a pocket on the fitted sheet. The elastics ability to slide around makes a tight fit impossible.

The pockets are very deep and slip over my other 6" mattress and stay in place...but the sheet will loosen up during use so I just pop off the pocket ends, re-tighten at the head of the bed when making the beds in the morning. I have several sets, and 2 sets I've had for almost 2 years, still in good shape and long wearing for sure!! HANNAH Dec 2, 2016 A: It depends on what size the memory foam mattress is. If it measures 60 inches wide and 80 inches long, this is a standard measurement for a Queen Size mattress so Queen Sheets would fit. Twin is smaller and a King size is Larger. You buy sheets accordingly. Same thing applies if you want a white zippered cover for the Memory Foam Mattress. I hope that info helps you closetsncurios Dec 4, 2016 A: These will fit.
