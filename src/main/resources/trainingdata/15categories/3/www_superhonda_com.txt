Yes, Probably Jul 28, 2017 - 12:12 PM - by AutoGuide.com Honda updated its elemental Civic with an all-new model that hit the road in 2010 as a 2011 model and carried through until an all-new-for-2017 model replaced it last year. With selection galore, numerous trim grades, performance levels and both coupe and sedan body styles, theres a used Civic out there thats just perfect for whatever your needs are. The Civic was even available as a hybrid, but well be focusing on more mainstream-powered versions of the Civic in this used car report.

This perennially popular midsize offering gains turbocharged engines, a more rigid structure, an advanced 10-speed automatic gearbox, and even a physical volume knob for the audio system. Talk about progress! Dimensionally, this 10th-generation Accord remains essentially the same size as todays version. Its wheelbase has been stretched by a little more than two inches, though it is more than half an inch lower. Width has grown by 0.39 inches, while overall length is fractionally less.

The Japanese automaker today unveiled its new Civic Type-R racecar for the TCR International Series. The car will be prepared by Italian outfit JAS Motorsport and will first take to the track early next year when the 2018 racing season kicks off. Unlike many motorsports competitions, the TCR Series uses cars that are based heavily on their production versions. The stock engine is used, though output is limited to 300 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Hondas Civic Type-R entry uses the stock engine, but builds on the package with a race-approved aerodynamics package, a different multi-link rear suspension setup, a racing ECU and an FIA-approved roll cage.

Jun 19, 2017 - 12:03 PM - by AutoGuide.com Honda is hoping to widen the appeal of the Civic Type R by introducing more model variants of the new hot hatch.

Hustle into a corner at, say, seven-tenths or more and theres nary a hint of understeer, the sworn enemy of front-wheel drive. Its the same story when mashing the accelerator at the apex, with torque steer virtually non-existent, the car pulling hard as it climbs through the gears. So this is what all the hypes been about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02Qtl-yZyk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02Qtl-yZyk Read more about the 2017 Honda Civic Type R Review at AutoGuide.com. 0 Replies | 993 Views » Recent Threads   RatingTitle, Username, & Date Last Post Replies Views Dimmable? heshtesh Yesterday 08:19 PM Yesterday 08:58 PM by heshtesh 1 25 New Here Forro Yesterday 12:58 PM Yesterday 12:58 PM by Forro 0 30 Hello everyone!!! joeeghatch 08-01-2017 01:36 PM Yesterday 12:57 PM by Forro 1 238 September 4th Longwkend...
