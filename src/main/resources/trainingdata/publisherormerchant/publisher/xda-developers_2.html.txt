So far I love this phone. Coming from the 6P its not renewed my interest in Android phones after not caring about upgrading for a year or two. Phone feels great in hand, runs smooth, looks awesome, and battery life impresses me. No complaints. Went to Best Buy to try out the S8 since Im still in the 14 day return period and decided to keep the G6.

I keep the same phones for years, last phone being an LG-G2. This is the first phone that I was willing to upgrade to. Only thing I need now is ROOT so I can have my backup LG-G6 and this one synced exactly and just swap if any issues occur. NANDROID backups are crucial to me, so it's the only thing I feel I need at this point.

First time with an LG Phone. It's alright so far- my older phone (nexus 5X) had the power button above the volume, and i'm pretty used to that. So that's an adjustment. But overall, I think that it's very nice. Fast, and feels durable. No major complaints.

As you can see, I keep my phones for YEARS. I just need root now for the Transparent modded Google Store, and to be able to remove bloatware.

Though, this phone runs circles around my Snapdragon S7 and doesn't seem to show any hint of slowing down.
