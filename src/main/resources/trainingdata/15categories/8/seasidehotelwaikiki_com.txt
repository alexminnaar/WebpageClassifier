Seaside Hotel Waikiki Seaside Hotel Waikiki ↓ Skip to Main Content Seaside Hotel Waikiki Menu Welcome to Seaside Hotel Experience the Essence of Waikiki Beach Just about everything on Waikiki Beach has been discovered, except maybe the Seaside Hotel. In the heart of Waikiki, and only two blocks from Waikiki Beach, this peaceful hotel is your hidden sanctuary in Honolulu’s premier shopping and dining district. Paradise, meet city. In a destination that’s famous for being popular, the Seaside is comfortable in its own skin. The hotel — 125 rooms over 13 floors — has a scale absent from most Waikiki Resorts, and the 1970s design creates a contemporary feel. Accommodations are bright and well‑appointed. Each room has a balcony to enjoy the tropical climate and breezes of Oahu. The hotel’s top floors provide ocean vistas, with city and skyline views nearly standard. We’re a block away from bustling Kalakaua Avenue, giving our guests both breathing room and a sense of real Waikiki.
