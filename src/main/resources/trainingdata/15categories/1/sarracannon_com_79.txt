Harper Brighton is standing on the precipice of a great and terrible war. The sapphire demon gates have fallen, but the four remaining priestesses of the Order of Shadows and their ruler–the mysterious High Priestess–continue to enslave demons from the Shadow World to steal their power. Harper and her friends in the Demon Liberation Movement target the Emerald gates–a dangerous and far more cunning enemy than any they have ever faced. No one is safe. Destruction comes in the blink of an eye, and the entire human world finds itself frozen, locked in perpetual darkness. Now, Harper must battle her darkest fears in order to save those she loves most. Will she lead them to victory or will everything they’ve fought for be lost forever?
