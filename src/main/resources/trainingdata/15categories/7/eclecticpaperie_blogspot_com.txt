I received some wonderful products to work with this month and I used the same products to create 3 different tags.  I hate to waste ink, stain, or paint and I try to find ways to use up all the color on a stencil rather than wiping it off.  Supplies: Tim Holtz Stencil - Blossom Tim Holtz Distress Stain - Abandoned Coral Gelli Arts Rubber Brayer Bo Bunny Stickers - Gabrielle Collection Ribbon   Tag #1 Create a tag from watercolor paper Place Blossom Stencil on top and ink with Abandoned Coral Stain Ink edges of tag with Abandoned Coral Stain, then mat with cardstock Wrap with ribbon Adhere to Coral cardstock Select stickers, mat with cardstock and add to tag       Tag #2 Flip stencil over onto another piece of watercolor paper Using a brayer, roll over stencil to release the left over stain Ink edges of tag with Abandoned Coral Stain, then mat with cardstock Wrap with ribbon Adhere to Coral cardstock Select stickers, mat with cardstock and add to tag     Tag #3 Create a tag from watercolor paper Place stencil on top and rub over it with a baby wipe releasing the remaining stain (you get a nice subtle design) Ink edges of tag with Abandoned Coral Stain, then mat with cardstock Wrap with ribbon Adhere to coral cardstock Select stickers, mat with cardstock and add to tag        So what do you think?  Do you use all the color off your stencils?

For those of you who don't visit my personal blog, I'm sharing a project that I created last week,  using embossing powders on a project. Here's my finished card and this is how I created it... I started with a piece of Mixed Media cardstock, perfect for any kind of ink, spray, or paint. I used Distress  Markers, a water brush and my non-stick craft sheet to add color to the background (and it appears that I'm still a  bit obsessed with pink and grey). I scribbled ink from the marker on the non-stick craft sheet and then picked up the ink with the water brush.  Then I just swiped the brush over the cardstock. Next I used some of Wendy's stencils to add some background design, using Watering Can Archival Ink  (my favorite color ever!) I also used the oval shape from the Spotlight Frames and Mask set to create a mask on my background, which I  then traced with a black Fude Ball pen. I then used the oval shape frame to act as a mask for my background so  that I could stencil the Sunburst shape and keep the burst within the border on my frame. I then stamped the  sentiment and swirl from the Paper Doll Art stamp set. My card features spot embossing, meaning that instead of embossing a large area I'm only embossing a portion  of a larger piece. You can see my Watering Can embossed lines at the top and bottom of my card. Next, I used the new Tiny Shapes Movers & Shakers dies (aren't they the tiniest, cutest dies ever!) to die cut a  few embossed butterflies. For quick and easy die cut embossing, I first added some Distress Ink to a scrap piece  of manila tag and then used clear embossing powder. Then I just die cut the shapes out of the already embossed  tag! Next, it was time to assemble! And here is my completed card... You can see that I embossed the butterflies, my gal's apron, gloves, and lips. This was done by first stamping or  coloring the image and then using a VersaMark pen to color over the area that was embossed, I used clear  powder for these areas so that the colors would show through the powder. Hope you enjoyed today's project!!

I've created ATCs with Tim Holtz Birds Crazy stamp set and Gelli Plate printing. I love my Gelli plate... love to create prints with them. I use them in my Art Journals, to make mixed media canvas, cards...but today I wanted to use them to make ATCs. Let's see the process.. I got prints on papers with Gelli plate, Acrylic Paints and Crafters Workshop Stencils. Cut them into ATC size.  For more layers in the background, I stamped on them with text and texture stamps. Adhered butterflies,Tim's tissue tape and Trellis diecut pieces. Splattered distress stain colors. Next I stamped Crazy Birds and colored them with Distress Inks. Fussy cut them and adhered on ATCs. And here are my four ATCs .....aren't they cute? Hope you liked them... Thank you so much Kim for this opportunity to write at this wonderful blog. I am grateful to you all readers as well for love and support.
