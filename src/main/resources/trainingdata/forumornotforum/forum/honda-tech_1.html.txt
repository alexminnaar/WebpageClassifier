First time drag racing       Thread Tools Search this Thread 07-13-2017, 10:55 AM   #1 boostedblue23 Honda-Tech Member Thread Starter   Join Date: Jul 2017 Posts: 21 First time drag racing Well, this weekend will be the first time taking my fully built turboed em1 to the track. I am making 430whp and am running 225/50/15 mickey Thompson Et Street R's. What should I put the tire pressure to? Also, I have launch control and right now I have it set too 6k rpms building 10lbs of boost off the line. Is that too high?   07-13-2017, 11:34 AM   #2 blackeg Honda-Tech Member     Join Date: Feb 2003 Location: schooling kids in ny, usa Posts: 9,799 Re: First time drag racing Id say you will find a happy point with the tire pressure somewhere around 10 psi cold. A good burnout will get them ready to go. dont forget to preload. after you light the first staging light, with the ebrake on kinda drag yourself up by working the catch point on the clutch until you light the second bulb. 6000rpm and 10 psi arent bad starting points, but really you will have to go through trial and error making adjustments. I guess with the launch rpm and boost start off with it spinning and keep dropping it down till you are just barely hooking up. we all know spinning aint winning, but its also not breaking **** as you would from dead hooking with no preload. good luck and have fun   07-13-2017, 12:03 PM   #3 boostedblue23 Honda-Tech Member Thread Starter   Join Date: Jul 2017 Posts: 21 Re: First time drag racing Thanks man!! Looking forward to it.   07-14-2017, 06:40 AM   #4 Pro-SeriesFab Honda-Tech Member   Join Date: Feb 2014 Location: Atlanta, GA Posts: 398 Re: First time drag racing I'd start high on the tire pressure (~14psi) and see what the track looks like when you get there. You want the highest tire pressure you can run with the lowest 60ft. If you keep dropping pressure past that point, the 60ft will stay the same and the ET/MPH will start dropping as the tires end up sucking up friction. See what it does at 14, then drop them to 12, then drop them to 10 if you picked up a fair amount on the 60ft from 14 to 12. If the track is garbage, you may even get the best 60ft as low as 8psi. Don't forget to bring an air pump or make sure the track has one if you dropped pressure and you didn't gain anything   07-14-2017, 02:14 PM   #5 boostedblue23 Honda-Tech Member Thread Starter   Join Date: Jul 2017 Posts: 21 Re: First time drag racing Hey man thanks! I will play around and see what works best.   07-15-2017, 10:47 PM   #6 bauergold Honda-Tech Member     Join Date: May 2006 Location: Yorba Linda, CA Posts: 915 Re: First time drag racing I would also run higher pressures. You're running drag radials which like a higher tire pressure than a slick does. I'd start around 16psi or so and drop from there.       Related Topics Thread Thread Starter Forum Replies Last Post Official Elon Musk thread Mike P.
