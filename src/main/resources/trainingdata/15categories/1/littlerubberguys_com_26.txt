If you're ever bored again and want to do some more SHF recolors, I'd love to see them!    On a related note, my dream "recolor" would have to be a recast of the Akuma Shogun figure to make a full-on Goldman, with a partially translucent body, sort of like the Crystal Bowie figma, only with stratae of other translucent colors to create that diamond armor effect.

There's no one way to go about achieving the effect. I tried to go for the look you described.     Also, are you a Cobra fan? I love so many elements about it, but haven't yet started on it. The figures are very intriguing, and I wonder how Cobra fans feel about the results of Figma's attempt at Crystal Bowie.

Is. Awesome! Thank you so much for humoring my random thought, haha. If Bandai could pull that off, I'm sure that would draw a lot of attention.   Also, are you a Cobra fan? I love so many elements about it, but haven't yet started on it. The figures are very intriguing, and I wonder how Cobra fans feel about the results of Figma's attempt at Crystal Bowie.   It's funny you ask that. I had seen the characters around before, but it wasn't until the Crystal Bowie Figma was announced that I actually started the series. I only read the first volume or two, and honestly wasn't really drawn in. It's weird, because I love manga from that time period, and "Star Wars meets James Bond", as it's sometimes described, nods to two of my other favorite franchises.  Maybe I didn't give it enough time. I plan to go back to read more eventually, but it seems that every time I check one series off my list, three more have grown in its place! You should definitely still check it out - it's gotta be a best-seller for a reason! 0 Check out my Instagram @ instagram.com/HobbyQuest Back to top #381 Mantaro9 Mantaro9 Budding Collector Members 74 posts Gender:Male Posted 16 May 2017 - 06:38 AM Do guys think we will get an Sh figuarts meat? I think if they do make one he would be an accessory kind of like the dog that came with terryman. 0 Back to top #382 toyhandle toyhandle Budding Collector Members 72 posts Posted 21 May 2017 - 08:42 PM I think he has a good chance. He's not the most exciting, but pretty vital. I'm sure Meat merch sells well enough.   I would expect him to be articulated. Due to his proportions, it may be easier to give him alternate straight and bent arms/legs like a Nendoroid figure.     There's a couple of ways I could see them selling him.   In a two pack with Suguru in a new costume, such as the one Suguru is wearing below, or...   Since the 7 Devil Choujin may be overall less big ticket items than many characters, Meat's figure could be split 7 ways, and packaged according to whichever Devil held that part in the arc. Would serve as an accurate accessory to the characters, as well as encouraging purchases of complete collections of all 7 Devils.     A good figure to start that off would be OCE Buffaloman with both bearded and bald heads as well as a Meat head.     Truthfully, I think the best option would be do do him as a single release. Imagining this plastic tray replaced with all things Meat just has me thinking he'd sell really well.

Looks like shiny hair and silver pants. 0 Back to top #384 toyhandle toyhandle Budding Collector Members 72 posts Posted 05 June 2017 - 08:36 AM   OCE Scramble for the Throne Kinnikuman 0 Back to top #385 Kanji Kanji Serious Collector Members 174 posts Posted 05 June 2017 - 12:51 PM Yeah, just seen this. This is a really tough one. I don't usually go for the OCE variants. Brocken Jr will be my first one (if you disregard Ramenman).   This however is pretty iconic for his battle with Nemesis. Might have to pick it up. 0 Back to top #386 rajikaru rajikaru Budding Collector Members 12 posts Gender:Male Posted 13 June 2017 - 12:35 PM I'm not sure if it's just the perspective of the image, but it looks like the arm size on OCE Scramble Kinnikuman might be different? They seem at least a bit larger than the other Kinniikuman arms. 0 Back to top #387 Kanji Kanji Serious Collector Members 174 posts Posted 05 July 2017 - 11:27 AM Hey guys, in response to the character poll post I just made (http://www.littlerub...howtopic=257977) I wonder what this means for upcoming Figuarts?   Silverman has made a massive impression, so hopefully he'll be confirmed soon. I loved the prototype! On the other hand, Sunshine sadly didn't make the top 20. I hope he isn't cancelled. I'd certainly accept a webshop exclusive!   Meanwhile Psychoman and Justiceman certainly left their mark after the last arc, and this shows in the votes. They are probably most likely candidates from the revival series after Budo, Nemesis and Silverman.   Finally, Blackhole and Super Phoenix seem to still be hanging on by the skin of their teeth. Not sure about Pentagon or Mammothman. Would be nice to see all 4 eventually.   As far as OCE's (God I hate them!) There are still a few figures that could get the alt. treatment:   Neptuneman (Already shown) Akuma Shogun (Minor repaint ver. already shown)   Kinnikuman Great (Red ver.) Buffaloman (Satan repaint?) Ataru Kinniku (More camo detail?) The Ninja (Chainmail torso resculpt like Brocken Jr.?)   Big The Budo (Does Strong count?) Ramenman (Anime colors) Sunshine (Original still to be released) Terryman (Already shown) Edited by Kanji, 05 July 2017 - 11:56 AM. 0 Back to top #388 Kinnikufan89 Kinnikufan89 Budding Collector Members 36 posts Posted 13 July 2017 - 09:52 AM It would absolutely break my heart if Sunshine got cancelled.  He's one of my favorite villains and the only character I've wanted since the beginning to still not have his own figure (although Omegaman is one that I feel I need more and more as time passes).  I'd pay just about any amount to get a hold of Sunshine if they'd just announce him and put my mind at ease.  This line is starting to feel a little repetitive with the OCE's and talks of alternative versions of the same characters and even with the additional props and pieces I'm just not willing to spend that much money on a figure I basically already have.  It would be nice to get Wolfman and Geronimo one day, but I don't think the fans really care about them that much now and the likes of Canadianman and Specialman probably aren't even being considered with how many more popular characters there are, but that's about it as far as Justice Choujin go.  I'd really just like to see some more diversity from this line and villains like Sunshine seem like a great place to start. 1 Back to top #389 darkhadou316 darkhadou316 Budding Collector Members 16 posts Posted 13 July 2017 - 10:30 PM I'm with you Kinnikufan89. This line is full of repaints with a little bit more accessories added to a repaint of a figure. I personally think that if it keeps up at this rate, it could be the demise of the line. I want other original characters not just repaints. It seems that since the figures are unique sculpts, they are trying to milk the longevity of giving the same figures over and over whereas the SH Figuarts line as a whole is having so many other licensed properties that are being made that the Kinnikuman is more of a niche. I cool one at that, but I would love to see more of the supporting cast and other people. I would vote in the polls if I knew who I was voting for but can't read japanese. I don't know if it would matter though.   I would love the Scramble for the Throne characters to be completed. Super Phoenix, Zebra, Big Body, Mariposa would be cool.   Atlantis, The Mountain, Mr Kamen, Junkman, Springman, STE King, Sneagator would be cool too.   And of course they could move on to creating more characters from the Perfect Choujin Arc since it's hot right now in the manga, and eventually the Nisei Tag Arc and Nisei characters too. I don't mind paying for the same character if it's a different sculpt or outfit but spare me the repaint redundancy.  I'm going to cash out for Brocken Jr's shirtless figure like I did for Scramble Suguru. I wish they would make his battle suit. (is that what it's called? The blue one with the cape and mask with the shoulder pads). That one should come with Meat. 1 Back to top #390 illadvised illadvised Wet Behind The Ears Members 3 posts Gender:Male Posted 27 July 2017 - 12:52 PM "I would love the Scramble for the Throne characters to be completed.

I have Nemesis, Ashuraman, Robin Mask, Warsman on the way... with Terryman preordered. Not sure how well the line is doing, but I hope Sunshine is just around the corner.

I've been scoping Mandarake every day since the 18th with no luck. Shoulda used a proxy I guess. 0 Back to top #392 illadvised illadvised Wet Behind The Ears Members 3 posts Gender:Male Posted 27 July 2017 - 02:22 PM Nice pictures illadvised and welcome to the thread! btw, where did you pickup your OCE Throne Suguru from? I've been scoping Mandarake every day since the 18th with no luck. Shoulda used a proxy I guess.   Thanks! An old high school bff of mine lives in Tokyo and got it for me at the Jump exhibition. He had preview access so he actually got it before it opened on the 18th and was able to get it to me by Friday (the same day my Buffaloman arrived). I didn't ask him for it, he just knew I just got into the SHF line recently and knew that I had a few on the way. He was there for other stuff so he only got just that one, but I can check in if he plans to go again. I know it runs through October, but last time I checked the event product page it said they were low on stock.   Edit: Yep, still says low supply on Suguru. The Ryotsu SHF is currently sold out, however. (Source: http://shonenjump-ten.com/goods/)   Edit 2: Kanji, check your PM.

Looking forward to it! Here is the collection so far. I so need to sort my display out! Currently missing OCE Robin Mask, Warsman, Ashuraman & Kinnikuman (skipping the September release). Waiting for Strong The Budo & Anime Terryman!! We still need tank top Suguru from Tag Arc! Fingers crossed for Sunshine announcement soon!

I'm freaking stoked!! Guessing the reference to 2016 is for pre-orders, not release. Tamashii have already concluded their announcements for the year so not expecting any of these to drop until Jan 2017. We just need that OCE Neptuneman now and we're upstraight.   I wonder who's going to be next??!!   Edited by Kanji, Today, 04:41 AM. 0 Back to top #398 kayfabe1985 kayfabe1985 Serious Collector Members 581 posts Gender:Male Location:Stuttgart, Germany via Chicago, IL Interests:Former Pro Wrestler so naturally Wrestling, Kinnikuman, Saint Seiya, Kinkeshi, Deka Kinkeshi & throw in some AoA! Posted Today, 12:03 PM I was wondering if there's a checklist for all releases? I think the line began in 2014 but I was wondering how many figures have been released total? 0 Back to top « Prev Page 16 of 16 14 15 16 Back to Kinnikuman / Ultimate Muscle Reply to quoted posts     Clear     LittleRubberGuys.com Forums → Little Rubber Guys Board → Kinnikuman / Ultimate Muscle Privacy Policy Change Theme IP.Board IP.Board Mobile IBR Caja Help Community Forum Software by IP.Board 3.4.4 Copyright © 2017 LittleRubberGuys.com   Sign In Need an account?
