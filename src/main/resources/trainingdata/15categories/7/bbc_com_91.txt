Just add one ingredient to each meal to create a healthy, balanced diet. A healthy diet for children The food a child eats in their early years can influence their dietary habits later in life, so it’s important to install good habits and a healthy relationship with food from an early age. Ensure your child’s nutritional requirements are met by aiming for three balanced meals a day with up to two healthy snacks. Get into the habit of trying different types of protein such as egg, fish, lean meat or legumes with meals and a couple of different vegetables. Children should also be encouraged to: · Eat plenty of vegetables, legumes and fruit – as many different colours as possible · Eat starchy carbs (such as low-sugar cereals, bread, rice, pasta and noodles) · Include lean meat, fish, poultry and/or alternatives for example nuts or legumes · Include milk, yogurts, cheeses or alternatives · Choose water as their main drink and to drink regularly throughout the day Care should be taken to: · Limit saturated fat and moderate total fat intake · Choose foods low in salt · Consume only moderate amounts of sugars and keep to guidelines on foods containing added or 'free' sugars   See our guides for more advice on giving your child a healthy diet Healthy foods kids will love Top 5 healthy family meals A balanced diet for toddlers A balanced diet for school children How much sugar should children have?

Comments (1) Questions (0) Tips (0) catie74 9th Aug, 2017 It is easy to get well over 5 portions into a kids diet. If you introduce these foods at the very start kids enjoy them. Don't make an issue if it, just make it normal. And I refuse to go down the 'hidden veg' route. Children just like adults deserve to know what they are eating. Tricking a child is only going to result in further issues. Instead include the child in all aspects of food prep, that way they feel they have some control.
