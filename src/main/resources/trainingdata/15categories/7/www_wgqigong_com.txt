HU — WILD GOOSE ONE, TWO AND FOUR DVDS ARE ON SALE! CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE Wild Goose Qigong is a complete exercise and healing system. Once taught only in secret, it was opened up to the public by the legendary Grand Master, Yang Mei-Jun in 1978. Comprised of 72 sets of both moving and still qigong, it is a safe and powerful way to make your body stronger, your mind sharper and your mood happier. Most training in the west only includes the first two sets of wild goose qigong. This is a movement oriented qigong system.   Qigong is one of the pillars of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); these are: Acupuncture, Acupressure, Herbal Medicines and Qigong. Also known as Dayan qigong, the wild goose system is also a great alternative or addition to Tai Chi, Yoga and all martial arts forms.  Qigong, qi gong, chi kung, or chi gung (simplified Chinese: 气功; traditional Chinese: 氣功; pinyin: qìgōng; Wade–Giles: chi gong; literally: "Life Energy Cultivation") is a holistic system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for health, spirituality, and martial arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, qigong is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi (chi), translated as "life energy". Dr. Binkun Hu is a medical qigong master and therapist providing Qigong workshops worldwide. He has been practicing for more than 50 years. Dr. Hu is one of the few living masters to have learned the entire system from Yang Mei-Jun. With his background in Traditional Chinese Medicine and a Ph.D. in Western Psychology, Dr. Hu has been instrumental in bringing the essence of both Taoist & Buddhist Qigong to the public in a systematic and approachable way. Dr. Hu always practices in street clothes and in ordinary parks and locations to further demonstrate that Wild Goose Qigong can be practiced by anyone and anywhere.   Dr. Hu offers workshops and individual treatment through his website here.   Grandmaster Yang, Mei-Jun was one of the true giants of modern qigong and energy medicine. She was the 27th Lineage holder of the Kunlun School Taoist tradition - a tradition that dates back to the Jin dynasty (265 ad). Yang, Mei-Jun passed away in 2002 at the advanced age of over 100 years.   We wish you great health and joy in doing this practice! — VIDEOS — THE WILD GOOSE QIGONG VIDEO COLLECTION NOW RESTORED AND REMASTERED IN HD NINE DVD SET - COMPLETE TRAINING SERIES This collection set includes all 9 Wild Goose Qigong DVDs at a discounted price from the DVD manufacturer (Createspace) Creating Flexibility through Qigong This is a great Qigong for all levels and types of practice including those from the tai chi and yoga traditions.  Now available in HD.
