But who in their career has tugged on the coat tails of others? Who has forged a career out of a moment, or a season? I vote Scott Clayton. Had one draft at the Dogs where (admittedly) he picked up 4 good players however it could be argued he was awful outside of that, with a raft of high end picks turning out to be rubbish. He then got offered the golden goose at Gold Coast, given enormous amounts of picks and concessions - and has produced absolute crap from it. I vote for Scott.   Pannalstaroz, May 29, 2017 #1 Reply PTizzle, Turly, Tibbedy and 20 others like this. (Log in to remove this ad.)

Too many flashy types not enough grunt when they started. Their players recruited from other clubs were too old as they were cooked mostly by the time GC were ready to rise. GWS have done both far better.   Doctor Gero, May 29, 2017 #3 Reply wagstaff likes this. PP34 Finals MVP Carlton Other teams: Joined: Oct 09 Posts: 21,567 Always thought David Buttifant was overrated. The media made out like he was some sort of genius when the Pies won the flag in 2010. Fitness was definitely a part of why they won but the media seemed to overlook that the likes of Pendlebury, Swan, Sidebottom, Beams etc had all come on as footballers and were the reason they improved on the failures of past seasons. He came to Carlton with Malthouse and didn't do much for us at all.   PP34, May 29, 2017 #4 Reply Augustine, Catgirl, unplugged and 3 others like this.

If he hasn't had that much influence then I rate him as a coach.   PP34, May 29, 2017 #7 Reply Xenthor Club Legend Melbourne Other teams: Joined: Feb 16 Posts: 1,147 Location: KFC I just want to get in before someone says Paul Roos. He did so much to get Melbourne into the position it is now. People forget how bad we were around 2012-13 era before he came along. He practically saved our club and did more for our club in his 3 years than say Damian Hardwick has done for his in 7 or Nathan Buckley has done in his time for Collingwood   Xenthor, May 29, 2017 #8 Reply Tibbedy and Gysberts2Bate like this. gavaniacono Premiership Player Richmond Other teams: Wolverhampton Wanderers Joined: Oct 14 Posts: 4,713 Location: Hanoi Paul Roos Closely followed by Hutchinson, the short plump one.   gavaniacono, May 29, 2017 #9 Reply hutstar, drazah and Sttew like this. exxcessivve Team Captain Fremantle Other teams: Essendon, Geelong, PAFC, Peel Joined: Jan 17 Posts: 335 *a**** ****e******   exxcessivve, May 29, 2017 #10 Reply mike123 likes this.

Click to expand... You'd hope in this day and age he isn't the one with necessarily the most say. At Freo we have Lloyd and Bond seemingly outranking him for recruiting, and you'd think similar at the Saints   Van_Dyke, May 29, 2017 #14 Reply Barry_Badrinath Brownlow Medallist Richmond Other teams: Sack Dan Richardson Joined: Aug 11 Posts: 15,891 Location: 7th and Satisfied wal said: ↑ Majority of coaches never make it to a grand final, eight years in Hardwick hasn't even won a final Click to expand... Nobody rates Hardwick though. Lyon is talked up as a master coach.   Barry_Badrinath, May 29, 2017 #15 Reply Richo83, mike123, Fabes and 8 others like this.

Bootstrap Suspended Geelong Other teams: Joined: May 17 Posts: 76 Chris Scott. I'm absolutely adamant that anyone could have coached Geelong to a premiership in 2011 given the powerhouse we were. He's still coaching from the same playbook as what Bomber wrote. The only difference now to then is that we don't have the depth as what we had back then.

Luv_our_club Team Captain Hawthorn Other teams: Joined: Feb 17 Posts: 535 I watched Steve Kernahan during the 80s and thought he has been rated highly in retirement when CHF's are considered. He was a great player. I might be missing something because there are players I think are underrated. I think Chris Judd was sublime, at his best. He was good enough to carry a midfield. I think because of the great heights he reached his career legacy is a tad overrated. He didn't kick near 500 goals, win multiple premierships, astound us with his brilliance years after years, be player MVP year after year deservedly, but that is the kind of REP he has. His best years were in one of the BEST midfields ever of Cousins Kerr, Cox, and I forget the 4th and 5th but they were guns. At Carlton it was his toughness that impressed me, his inside play, and whenever he did anything on the outside the commentators yelled Judd!!!! too cheaply... Sadly, many players careers are pumped up because of commentators who want to commentate genius.   Luv_our_club, May 29, 2017 #22 Reply PonsfordMagpie, In Repair, TiggyTig and 6 others like this.

I think true judgement of Lyon should rest until we've seen him rebuild and take a list up. It's not his fault he hasn't had the chance yet. St Kilda wasn't his list but he was given the full go ahead for a flag so he did the best he could, before Fremantle offered him an offer he couldn't refuse with the window open. Now, he's got the chance to do what the truly genuine gun coaches did (Thompson/Clarkson/Matthews) have done and take a list of his own up. He should be involved at some level in the drafting etc. He also should have been at St Kilda but obviously his priority was not developing draftees. And lastly I'd probably agree he is somewhat overrated by flogs like Barrett who somehow think he won 4 games on purpose last year, but when the majority of the footy public shouts out about Lyon can't build a list (when he's never had the chance to) I'd say he's not overrated on that note   SterlingArcher, May 29, 2017 #24 Reply mike91 and Judd2Sewell like this. cecil All Australian Western Bulldogs Other teams: Joined: Feb 10 Posts: 723 I heard Brad Scott referred to as "one of the best coaches in the AFL" over the weekend.   cecil, May 29, 2017 #25 Reply mike123, Turly, Pep Fraudiola and 2 others like this.
