Discussion in 'AFL - The Australian Football League' started by PhatBoy, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:13 PM. Put it out there PhatBoy Norm Smith Medallist Geelong Other teams: Joined: May 16 Posts: 7,008 .... Eddie and his band of idiots just assuming that because Buckley was a great player, he would make a great coach? This is prompted by the Pies TPP thread by the way, and the assertion by one of their fans in that thread that for the foreseeable future, the Pies are f***ed. Let's have a look. 2007 - Pies almost knock off arguably (Essendon 2000 and Carlton 95 are the other candidates) the best team of the last 3 decades in a prelim. They hang around that mark for 5 seasons, at no point really threatening to disappear from the top-of-the-ladder landscape. They knock off a great, great grand final team in St Kilda, and go through 2011 losing to only one side. Their squad is still relatively young. It has a coach who has done all their is to do, and who has proven that with an established squad, he can rack up wins like the Suns rack up lines. Yet all along, their president who knows a lot about business but seemingly little about football, has pencilled in a succession plan for something that is working like a well oiled machine already. In the time since the side has literally gone backwards every year. Now they're in a right shithole. Long winded opening post, I know, but can this entire predicament be blamed on the 'well he was a great player for us so he has to be a great coach' philosophy that has f***ed teams for years?   PhatBoy, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:13 PM #1 Reply Aramis, Half Forward, CheapCharlie and 1 other person like this.

Honestly mate, I have no real opinion on their situation. I hate them as a team, always have, but really hadn't given this much thought until reading Pies fans saying they're up shit creek for the time being. Genuinely curious to see whether both Pies fans, and outsiders, think it's a direct consequence of pretty much foregoing the old 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush' mantra.   PhatBoy, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:22 PM #4 Reply PhatBoy Norm Smith Medallist Geelong Other teams: Joined: May 16 Posts: 7,008 10571z said: ↑ Yes like many clubs before he was given a coaching career due to his stellar playing career.

Do you think if they kept Mick on, they'd be where they are now?   PhatBoy, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:23 PM #5 Reply kaiserchief13 Brownlow Medallist West Coast Other teams: Eagles, Lakers, Bayern, Trojans Joined: Jul 11 Posts: 14,590 Location: Melbourne PhatBoy said: ↑ I know he was.

No way - players such as Heath Shaw never would've been let go. I consider Buckley similar to Chip Kelly in the NFL, as in it's his way or the high way. In professional sports it simply doesn't work as these are grown men with lives outside of their employment. The best coaches are able to unify different types of people so they play well together on game day, not just get rid of them, especially when they are a good player.   kaiserchief13, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:31 PM #6 Reply Half Forward likes this. 10571z Norm Smith Medallist Collingwood Other teams: Joined: Aug 06 Posts: 5,669 Location: Christmas Hills PhatBoy said: ↑ I know he was.

Mick had a brilliant coaching record of making grand finals and rebuilding.   10571z, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:33 PM #7 Reply Occidental Debutant Collingwood Other teams: Joined: Oct 16 Posts: 135 Neither Geelong or Collingwood have played in a GF since 2011. That's 6 years for both of us. You are a chance again in this 7th year, but after watching you struggle to beat an undermanned Pies last weekend I don't think your going to make it. So what's your measure of success? Does regularly making finals only to bomb out before the Grand Final count? Win another flag and then you can get back to all of us in Pie land.   Occidental, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:36 PM #8 Reply Benny78 Club Legend Geelong Other teams: Joined: Apr 16 Posts: 2,241 Location: Broadmeadows Oh cool here we go more shit   Benny78, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:37 PM #9 Reply herculez09 likes this.

Sorry to piss on the fire that is your syphillitic burning sensation but this has nothing to do with Geelong vs Collingwood. We haven't won a comp since (more recently than you, mind) and probably won't win one this year. What that has to do with this, f*** knows. I want to know why a team poised to absolutely dominate has fallen arse over tit. If you want to get menstrual over the question being asked, take it up with the club.   PhatBoy, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:41 PM #11 Reply (Log in to remove this ad.)

IMO would be in first or second year of a new coach and be a middle range team. Which is satisfactory for some teams but not Collingwood.   Hawkboy62, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:48 PM #13 Reply Occidental Debutant Collingwood Other teams: Joined: Oct 16 Posts: 135 PhatBoy said: ↑ Sigh.

Boo hoo precious - you cite that my club is run by a bunch of idiots and that we are f****d for years. So I respond that you have nothing to get excited about yourself and you throw a tantrum. I just don't get it - it was you lot that beat us in the 2011 GF, so how is it that we were supposed to dominate? We lost. Perhaps Geelong have equally fizzled out since then?   Occidental, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:49 PM #14 Reply msb77 Senior List Sydney Other teams: Joined: Sep 13 Posts: 250 They can't possibly risk reappointing Buckley, imagine if they did and failed again next year? Surely pies supporters agree. Then again, it wouldn't surprise with Ed still in charge. His obsession in Buckley has literally put his club back years. Champion, awesome footballer, no good at coaching.   msb77, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:57 PM #15 Reply PhatBoy Norm Smith Medallist Geelong Other teams: Joined: May 16 Posts: 7,008 Occidental said: ↑ Boo hoo precious - you cite that my club is run by a bunch of idiots and that we are f****d for years.

Again, what does this have to do with the question, how does it answer it? It's like a German telling an Italian to stop criticising Hitler. F*** me, answer the conundrum or f*** off out of the thread.   PhatBoy, Aug 23, 2017 at 10:58 PM #16 Reply Occidental Debutant Collingwood Other teams: Joined: Oct 16 Posts: 135 You must have trouble with comprehension. I've answered your question. We did not dominate anything. That's my answer. Yes we win a flag, then we lose the GF still under Mathouse in the next year, then we lose the Prelim under Buckley.... all good efforts. But what is this idea we were "supposed" to dominate - I have answered it. We did well but we did not dominate - we won a flag (thank god), and that was it. Stop over playing it. Stop believing the hype. I am a Pies fan and I never believed in any idea that we were "supposed" to do anything. We won a flag, and got really close a few times. Not a bad return. But any idea based upon the premice that the side was bound to "absolutely dominate" is flawed.   Last edited: Aug 23, 2017 at 11:22 PM Occidental, Aug 23, 2017 at 11:15 PM #17 Reply PhatBoy Norm Smith Medallist Geelong Other teams: Joined: May 16 Posts: 7,008 Occidental said: ↑ You must have trouble with comprehension.

You had a shit hot side mate. We did too and 3 wins from as many meetings in 2011 suggests we beat you on merit not luck, but your squad was sensational.   PhatBoy, Aug 23, 2017 at 11:26 PM #18 Reply Always Ballin Club Legend West Coast Other teams: Joined: Jan 15 Posts: 2,864 Location: Main Forum Poster Should have never gotten rid of Mick.   Always Ballin, Aug 24, 2017 at 12:43 AM #19 Reply Bipolarbear Browns Fan Essendon Other teams: Parramatta, San Antonio, Everton Joined: May 08 Posts: 21,174 Location: Sandy Bay #standbyhird   Bipolarbear, Aug 24, 2017 at 12:43 AM #20 Reply BIGNEDKELLY Club Legend Collingwood Other teams: Joined: Jul 13 Posts: 1,218 PhatBoy said: ↑ Ok, simplify it then.

True, but guys like Blair, Toovey McCaffer, Dawes, wellingham were more shit than they were hot. The rest chased retirement, $$$ or puff the magic dragon.   BIGNEDKELLY, Aug 24, 2017 at 1:57 AM #21 Reply PIE-BOI likes this.
