For many, the base IS 200t would be a great choice, but its only available with rear-wheel drive. On the other hand, the range-topping IS 350drives all four wheels but can be expensive and fuel thirsty. To try to alleviate this issue, Lexus has recently introduced a model right in the middle of the lineup that can only be had with all-wheel drive.
