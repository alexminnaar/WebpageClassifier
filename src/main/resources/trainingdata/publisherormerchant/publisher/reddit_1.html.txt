(self.MachineLearning) submitted 47 minutes ago by Xirious Hi all, So one of the major topics in machine learning is Generative Adversarial Networks. I'd like to find out some solid academic motivations for why there's so much interest in this. Obviously we generate new samples but are these good enough to supplement smaller datasets? I also realise the discriminator can be used for downstream tasks such as classification if adapted post original training. What about networks such as InfoGAN? I'm sorry if this seems like a vague question but I'm trying to grasp why so much interest is being shown in these, admittedly cool, networks. 5 comments share report all 5 comments sorted by: best topnewcontroversialoldrandomq&alive (beta) [–]NopileosX2 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago* (3 children) maybe start with this http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2017/video/s7502-ian-goodfellow-generative-adversarial-networks.mp4 it explains what GANs are and what you can do with them. I hope this helps you a bit. Edit: Also nice https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/07/07/GAN.html it is pretty new and a nice example what you can do with GANs.

Thank you. Your Apple link just directs me to a not found page (on mobile/chrome). Any idea why? permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]NopileosX2 0 points1 point2 points 22 minutes ago (1 child) fixed the link, somehow there wasn't a space between the link and "it" permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Xirious[S] 0 points1 point2 points 14 minutes ago (0 children) Wow that's brand new. A detailed explanation of the example Goodfellow gives in the video. Thanks once again! Have a fantastic day :) permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–]Kaixhin 0 points1 point2 points 7 minutes ago (0 children) The idea of learning a cost function is very powerful. A great example that doesn't involve generating images is generative adversarial imitation learning, which applies the general concept behind GANs to trying to learn the underlying reward function behind the actions of an expert. In this case the reward function isn't learned, but you get a surrogate reward function from the discriminator that can be used in its place. As a quick motivation for imitation learning, we may not be able to manually specify a reward function for driving cars, but we could collect lots of car driving data and try and infer a reward function for the task. permalink embed save report give gold reply about blog about source code advertise careers help site rules FAQ wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy. © 2017 reddit inc.
