"We were just leaving a conference in Monterey and needed some quiet alone time. This place was perfect. Situated on Moonstone beach, the sounds and views are jaw dropping! We booked the suite and were not disappointed! Huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub, wonderful shower, comfortable bed and a fireplace (had a little bit of an issue operating it). We toured Hearst Castle, walked on the beach every morning and visited some wineries! Look forward to coming back to this wonderful place." Availability and Reservations >> Blue Whale Inn . .
