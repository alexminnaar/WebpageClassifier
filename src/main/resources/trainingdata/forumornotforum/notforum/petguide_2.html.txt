What to do with all that cat fur you collect from around the house, or that collects on your brush when you groom your pet? Use it for arts and crafts, of course! Okay, we know that sounds really weird, but it’s actually something that people do. In fact, there’s even a book about it – check out the best-selling book (for crazy cat people, that is) Crafting with Cat Hair. Below are just a few of the many ways that you can use your kitty’s constant shedding for some really cute and fun projects. Finger Puppets Here’s a little something fun that you can do with the fur you collect when you brush your cat: make adorable finger puppets.

Once you have your cat fur sheets, set them aside and grab a piece of thin cardboard. Cut out a cute shape of your choosing, whether that’s a little kitten or a bunny or anything else that you think would look adorable on your finger. Once you have the shape, you can glue down the cat fur sheets to cover the cardboard entirely and shape it into a cone to fit your finger. Finally, decorate your little finger puppet however you like, whether you want to add some gems for the eyes or a ribbon around the neck to look like a collar (or anything else you can think of). Super Simple Cat Toys Yet another way that you can use your cat’s fur is by creating homemade toys for your pet to play with.

Then take some fabric or felt, which could be made from your cat’s fur or can be bought in an arts and crafts store. Cut it down to the appropriate size and wrap it around the mass of cat fur, sewing it to close the gaps securely. Once you are done, let your cat use his new toy to keep himself occupied. You can even try putting some catnip inside the toy to make it more enticing. Jewelry Crafting cat fur jewelry is another clever way to use your cat’s fur. Sounds totally strange, but people do it. After purchasing some jewelry-making tools at a local arts and crafts shop, you can roll your cat’s fur into tight beads. Then you can use those to make necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and rings. A good tip is to gather your cat’s fur from a brushing session, leaving it in a pile that is loose at first. Then roll the loose hairs between the palms so that all of the individual strands will come together and create a solid bead in the ideal shape. Just when you thought there wasn’t anything you could do with your cat’s loose fur other than throw it away, a few creative minds have shared a lot of ideas online and in books so you can breathe new life into all of that hair. So go ahead and get crafty, and see if you can come up with some original, interesting, and fun uses for your cat’s fur.   Tweet Print Email Go Back Print this page< /li> Tagged as: cat fur, cat fur jewelry, crafting with cat fur, Crafting with Cat Hair, DIY cat toys, Finger Puppets, weird cat stuff Related Readings Tips For Removing And Keeping Dog Fur Off Your Clothes Tips & Advice Here's what you can do to keep that extra layer of pet fur off your clothes. 9 Signs You’re A Crazy Cat Lady Blog,General Information Hey, we've all heard the joke, and yes, it's kinda funny.
