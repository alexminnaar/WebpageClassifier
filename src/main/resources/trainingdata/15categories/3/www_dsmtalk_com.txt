I've been getting a lot of PMs lately from folks not familiar with this rule. Each new member to register on DSMtalk automatically enters a seven (7) day "lurker" period, in which you are permitted to view and search the forums, use the private messaging system, but NOT post threads or replies. Seven days after your join date, you should be able to post in the forums. If after 8 days you still cannot post, please notify me or another admin or mod and we'll take care of it. This rule is in place to deter trolls and spammers from registering only to post useless junk. There are NO exceptions to the lurker rule. I will NOT respond to PMs about exceptions to this rule. 0 Replies | 30,320 Views 10 Supercars That Are Surprisingly Affordable Used May 03, 2017 - 10:42 AM - by AutoGuide.com Quote: Supercars are expensiveuntil theyre a few years old.

Heres a look at some of our favorites.
