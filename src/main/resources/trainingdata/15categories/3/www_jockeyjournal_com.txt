We’ve had a long hiatus since this page has been welcoming or relevant, but some changes have come down the pipe. Our new mission is to highlight some of the very best the Jockey Journal calls home, and maybe a few interesting things from other places. If you’ve got suggestions, message the moderators. Today, we’re showcasing a pretty special Jockey Journalist and his project. In case you’ve been living under a rock, one of your fellow members, Christian Newman, has been working his fingers to the bone trying to get his bike some primo real estate this summer at the Oak Canyon Ranch. He’s planning on putting his bike into the Born Free show by simple dint of perseverance: Christian has a willingness to make items most would never dream of attempting to fabricate. It appears he’s planning on acting on every one of those nutty ideas that come occasionally to those of us who build bikes. The only difference is Christian seems to have ’em a lot more often, and he outworks everyone else by acting on what seems like all of them. His bike is motivated by a ’40 Knuckle, and his frame is handbuilt. ” I have designed, fabricated, and assembled every piece of the frame and fork with the exception of the tires, chainring, brake rotor, a few miscellaneous parts and some of the hardware,” he says. That doesn’t sound too weird just yet — but we ain’t done telling you about it. The frame is mirror-polished 316 stainless steel which also carries the oil. To keep things slender, he’s running the sprocket and brake disc outboard of the frame. And the front end? It’s a girder. That he built. From scratch. That tasty number up above is a little example of the sort of mechanical creativity kicking around this guy’s grey matter. Christian designed a new kicker and clutch release arm for the 4-speed backing up the Knuck, and then executed it (beautifully) in metal. He’s been displaying this level of ingenuity throughout the course of his project. Newman is building a killer bike, and making the Jockey Journal an interesting place to visit, largely because of his build thread located here. Christian has invested not just time and effort and money in his project, but he’s also taken time to better the Jockey Journal. He’s written nice, clear descriptions of what he is doing, and his photos are pretty damn excellent. Fortunately, you can return the favor! Do him a solid and go help him become the People’s Champ. Take some time out of your day and go do one or all of the following: •On the Show Class Instagram page, simply comment with the word “vote” •Pull a lever over at Lowbrow Customs, one of the site sponsors •Head to the Show Class poll and show your fellow Jockey Journalist some support Go get ’em, Newman. We’re rooting for you! Bonneville Stories Part IV – 1953 Twin Engine Harley Knucklehead Dragster Posted on April 9th, 2013 by Administrator Filed under: Uncategorized Robert Bud Schmitt, now 81 years old, built and rode THE MONSTER a two engine Harley Davidson motorcycle which ran at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1955. The engines were eighty-inch knuckleheads with 12:1 fuel burning pistons and Bus Schaller reground cams and a carburetor on each cylinder. In 2005, the 50 year anniversary of his run, Bud returned to the Salt Flats and raced a V Rod. Best speed – 125 mph. In 2006, Bud crashed the V Rod at 125 mph and walked away after sliding 500 feet on his stomach. This is the longest recorded slide at the Flats. In 2007 Bud rode the V Rod again best speed 132 mph. In 2008 Buds best speed was 169 mph. Bud plans to live to be 100 but will race until he is 92.
