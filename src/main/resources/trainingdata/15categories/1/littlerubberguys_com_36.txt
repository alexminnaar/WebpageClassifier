I've had 4 flesh sets as well, now only down to one. Sold my muscle set, other than my Satan cross. So other than a few stray muscles here and there I'm pretty much out of the muscle game. Only Kinkeshi for me. 0 INSTAGRAM Back to top #78 Sydot Sydot Serious Collector Members 456 posts Gender:Male Location:Philadelphia Posted 04 June 2017 - 05:11 AM Sold my muscle set, other than my Satan cross.
