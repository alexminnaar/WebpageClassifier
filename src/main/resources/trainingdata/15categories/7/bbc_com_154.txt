The drugs were confiscated over the weekend, police say, and an Austrian father and son have been arrested. It's thought the drugs would have been sold on the internet under the slogan "Trump makes partying great again". Ecstasy pills can sometimes kill drug takers but more commonly induce nausea, panic, paranoia and agitation. Experts in the UK have warned the drug is getting stronger, leading to a rise in the number of people going to hospital for treatment for mental and behavioural issues.

One side of the tablets shows Mr Trump's face and exuberant hairstyle while the president's surname is written on the reverse.
