Top 10 Cars Bleeding Sales in 2017 Share Tweet Subscribe Get AutoGuide.com in your Inbox Like AutoGuide.com on Facebook By Stephen Elmer Jun 09, 2017 5 Although it may only be a little bit, the U.S. auto industry is shrinking. Over the first five months of 2017, U.S. auto sales are down by about 2 percent compared to last year, a drop of about 140,000 cars according to TTAC. This is not a huge crash by any means, especially considering 2016 was a record year for auto sales, but it does mean that some nameplates must be losing sales. So which vehicles are taking the biggest hit? Don’t expect to see any trucks or SUVs on the list, as that segment has gained about 225,000 units year-to-date, one of the positive signs in the industry. Here is a list of the top 10 volume vehicles with the biggest sales decline. For the most relevant look, all vehicles with less than 30,000-annual sales were not included, along with vehicles which have been discontinued, like the Jeep Patriot. 10. Kia Soul We kick things off with the small Kia Soul, which has seen sales decrease by 25.2 percent. Year-to-date sales in 2017 are sitting at 43,623, while last year Kia had moved 58,299 Souls by this point. 9. Ford Fusion Ford Fusion sales are down by 26 percent in 2017 compared to 2016. Last year, Ford had sold 120,313 Fusions by this point, while in 2017, just 89,086 Fusions have sold. The Fusion is just one of a few passenger cars on the list, as car sales seem to be shrinking in the face of growing crossover sales. 8. Ford Mustang The Mustang hasn’t had the hottest 2017 either, with a 27.8 percent drop in sales, with 38,422 cars sold year-to-date compared to 53,189 units last year. Through the beginning of this year, muscle car sales at Chevy and Dodge are flat, though they are not dropping like the Mustang. It is possible that the redesigned Chevy Camaro stole some attention from the Mustang, while it’s also possible that buyers could be waiting until the refreshed 2018 model year car arrives. 7. Hyundai Sonata Coming in the seventh spot is yet another sedan, the Hyundai Sonata. Sales are down by 27.9 percent year-to-date, representing 66,768 cars sold this year versus 92,547 moved in 2016. This follows in the trend of passenger sedan sales taking a hit. 6. Kia Sedona It seems that minivans are another segment with declines across the board, and the Sedona isn’t seeing the worst of it. This Kia is down by 29 percent compared to the same time period last year. In 2017, 12,998 Sedonas have been sold compared to the 18,297 that had been sold at this time last year. 5. Toyota Avalon Even more so than midsize sedans, full-size passenger car sales have taken a sales hit recently. The Toyota Avalon, fifth on the list, has seen a 29 percent drop, just like Kia’s Sedona. In 2017, 14,215 Avalons were sold, while 2016 saw 20,013 units sold. 4. Honda Odyssey Honda’s minivan took the biggest hit in the segment, but it has a decent excuse. Sales are down by 29.8 percent, but there is a brand new Odyssey hitting dealerships this year, so buyers are waiting around for the new model to arrive. So far in 2017, 37,010 of Honda’s minivan have sold, compared to 52,698 from last year. 3. Chevrolet Malibu Another midsize car makes the list near the top, the Chevy Malibu. Sales are down by 29.9 percent, just missing that 30 percent mark. That isn’t to say Chevy hasn’t sold a few Malibus, with 73,087 moving in 2017 compared to 104,187 last year. 2. Chevrolet Impala Another full-size sedan is on the list, but it’s not even that close to the number one spot. The Impala is down 35.3 percent in 2017, moving 28,504 units compared to last year’s 44,055. 1. Jeep Compass Topping the list is the Jeep Compass, which has seen its sales cut in half. Compass sales are down by 58.1 percent, with just 17,435 units moving in 2017 compared to 41,608 units in 2016. This could be partly blamed on how old the Compass model is, but the biggest reason is, yet again, a new model. The Compass has been entirely redesigned for 2017 and as the new model hits dealerships, there should be a sharp spike in sales. So by the end of the year, Compass sales should return back to where they were previously.

Lambo9871 The Compass looked good to me back in 2013 but its looks got outdated very quickly, i think it needed a new generation back in 2014. Jeep produced the 1st generation compass for 10 years and for a car such as the compass that is too much, i think its outdated looks is one of the reasons people did not buy it. The new 2018 Jeep Compass looks so much better. nick1946 Good to see the Ford Fusion take a dive. I was interested in the sport model but was shocked to see it priced like a BMW nick1946 Chev deserves a drop in the Malibu because THEY decided what is best for us. Nice design but to get most things a lot of want you have to buy the top model. The 1.5 L is a joke for those who like a car and safety features available needs to follow either Toyota idea or at least Honda method of selling. nick1946 Sonata is boring for 2017 kaffekup I think in many cases, everyone who wants one got one; Soul sales, for instance, have been really high for quite a while. The looks haven’t changed much, and since they last well, there isn’t much need to buy a new one. The Sonata gets a substantial refresh for 2018 and should pick up. I do agree that it’s a shame that, to get features you want, like safety tech, you have to shell out for a top model. Know something we don't? Send us your Tips!
