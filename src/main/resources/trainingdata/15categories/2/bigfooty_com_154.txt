Discussion in 'AFL - The Australian Football League' started by Rory Walkerfield, Apr 24, 2017. Put it out there ? Should ANZAC Day be the two best Vic sides? Yep - lock it in Eddie 70 vote(s) 30.2% No - leave it as is you bonehead 162 vote(s) 69.8% Page 1 of 16 1 ← 2 3 4 5 6 → 16 Next > Rory Walkerfield Norm Smith Medallist Adelaide Other teams: Joined: Oct 12 Posts: 7,003 There was a good suggestion on our board that the ANZAC Day clash should be shaken up a bit so that the two best Vic sides from the previous year play each other. Given ANZAC Day can fall on any day of the week it makes sense for it to not involve sides that would need to travel. Surely this would be a better spectacle than watching Bombers / Pies every year? (Noting that a Hawks / Cats game this year would be an anomaly given Hawks form)   Rory Walkerfield, Apr 24, 2017 #1 Reply MacMum, Snake_Baker and moistie like this.

Well, the TV audience could probably be maximised by having a close game, so people don't feel compelled to switch off a ten goal belting at halftime.. But I would have thought this year is a bad example, because the two teams seem fairly evenly matched. It fills the stands and gives us something to watch on Anzac Day. And possibly gives the sides that play against the Dons and Pies the following week a leg up, with a couple of days' extra break .   MC Extra Dollop, Apr 24, 2017 #4 Reply chogby likes this.

So I'm not sure last years performance correlates to a better contest. What method would be used to determine 'best Vic teams'? Ladder position or post-finals position?

AFL won't and shouldn't tamper with something that gets 90k+ through the gate every year. Would 90K+ come to see the Dogs and Geelong this tuesday for the game? I doubt it, it just wouldn't feel like Anzac day.   LukasTheGreat, Apr 24, 2017 #12 Reply PIE-BOI, Moonwatcher, Simple_guy and 2 others like this.

It is about money and the AFL as a private entity. Decisions will not be made for the good of the game (despite the AFL claiming they are custodians of the game of Australian Rules Football), they will be made to make the AFL competition as attractive as possible to get as many $ through as possible. I doubt there is any other sport that has such a disconnect between the highest level competition(s) and every other competition - in the way it is played, marketed, rules are changed on a whim, etc. And good luck to them, they have got it and they will keep it. And as such, leave Anzac Day to Essendon and Collingwood. Not the best game or the logical matchup each year, but the one that will make the most money.   PowerForGood, Apr 24, 2017 #15 Reply QuietB Brownlow Medallist Hawthorn Other teams: Joined: May 08 Posts: 17,784 Location: Melbourne They can have it. Not that it matters much this year for the Hawks but I do not see any advantages playing a midweek game of footy. They get a Wednesday game next year - lucky them   QuietB, Apr 24, 2017 #16 Reply GuzzLG Brownlow Medallist Essendon Other teams: Joined: May 07 Posts: 14,215 Location: Melbourne ANZACs didn't go to war for communism, just allied with the commies.   GuzzLG, Apr 24, 2017 #17 Reply PeaTea likes this.

With the corresponding scores of the listed teams' first meeting in those years. Strengthens your comment that they rarely live up to the billing. 2017 - Dogs vs Cats (not yet played) 2016 - Hawks 93 vs North 84 2015 - Hawks 130 vs North 70 2014 - Hawks 87 vs Cats 106 2013 - Hawks 145 vs Pies 90 2012 - Cats 84 vs Pies 96 2011 - Pies 108 vs Saints 51 2010 - Cats 46 vs Saints 70 2009 - Hawks 103 vs Cats 111 2008 - Cats 127 vs Pies/North 114 (chose North based on ladder position as the eliminating factor) 2007 - Dogs 112 vs Demons 106 Avg. margin: 26.3 Avg. margin for the last 10 ANZAC day games: 34.8 So the current rivalry is MEH but it wouldn't be much less MEH with the suggested change anyhow.   onthemoney, Apr 24, 2017 #20 Reply Ari likes this.
