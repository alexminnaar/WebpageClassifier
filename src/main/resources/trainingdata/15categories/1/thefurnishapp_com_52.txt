This may include reports showing employees’ salaries, customer’s credit card information or medical history and much more. When such documents are not properly destroyed through effective document shredding practices, there is a risk that they could fall into the wrong hands. This could result in identity theft, loss of funds and much more for your customers and employees alike. As a business, you may be held liable for such events if you fail to use proper paper shredding services and practices in your operations. Closer analysis of the situation will reveal why you may need to improve your document destruction practices. The Impact of Identity Theft on Your Business Identity theft and other related crimes are more than just a stressful hassle for your customers and employees to deal with. In some cases, they may lose hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. They may also spend countless hours trying to rectify the situation through dealing with credit card companies, credit reporting agencies and more. In addition, there undoubtedly is pain and suffering associated with this process. When your business is linked to identity theft or other related crimes, you may be exposed to an expensive liability lawsuit that covers all aspects of the impact this situation had on their lives. More than that, the media may pick up the story, and this could result in a disastrous public relations nightmare that can be difficult for your business to overcome. Between the legal costs and the potential loss of income, your company may experience a huge financial hit. How Paper Shredding Services Can Help Through document shredding practices, you can ensure that all private and personal documents are properly destroyed. While your team could shred documents on your own with a small shredder, it is best to use professional paper shredding services. Through professional document destruction services, you can drastically reduce your liability exposure. This is because professional services use a locked storage box for documents until they are ready to be picked up and shredded. Professional services use the best possible method of shredding to yield superior results for you. The liability risk that companies face through improper document destruction practices can be significant, but there is an easy resolution to dealing with this risk. You simply have to hire the right company to provide paper shredding services. When shopping around, look for a company that uses on-site shredding using the hammermill shredding method for the best results.
