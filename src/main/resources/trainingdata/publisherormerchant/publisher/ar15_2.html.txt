My issue is for the last 2 months I have been shooting my AKs and not using my ARs. With all the practicing I am doing with this platform I feel like I should be using it for home defense. Which brings me to my point: Has anyone done barrier/over penetration tests with the 7.62x39? I have watched the ballistic tests and it seems like Hornady and or 8m3 may be the best shot.

Is there any other decent American jhp defense type loads? cornhskr When in doubt, empty the magazine Joined May 2009 Posts 5274 EE 100% (35) WA, USA Posted: 5/8/2017 9:06:47 PM EDT [Last Edit: 5/8/2017 9:12:35 PM EDT by cornhskr] Yup, 8M3 from SGAMMO, just like you mentioned.

Both did a good job. I think either one would be a reliable option for your circumstances. Just my anecdotal experience. lostintejas Joined Mar 2016 Posts 381 EE 0% (0) TX, USA Posted: 5/9/2017 2:58:57 PM EDT U.S. manufacture--PDX1 or Fusion. The Hornady SST would seem to perform better for hunting, but would work just fine, and YMMV. Combloc ammo--Tula 8M3 or Yugo M67. All are the best performing of the ammo we get in this country that is readily available for retail purchase. All will require you NOT to shoot in the direction of sleeping children or guests. ANY ammo worth having that will punch holes in a BG will punch holes through several walls. I keep the Comblock choices loaded for SD/HD, and have the same freedom as you. Closest neighbor is over 100 yards and the next 2 are close to 200.

I remember Rob Ski and Paul commenting in one of their videos the same thing. It went like, "what happens when you use an AK for home defense? You shoot through your house and into your neighbor's house." Even at 100 or 200 yards, can you be sure it won't penetrate an exterior wall at the right trajectory to get to the neighbor's house? I had a bit of a woopsie ND moment one time on the top floor of a 2-story house with basement that I used to own, and the Golden Tiger 7.62 went through two floors/ceilings, two walls, a hollow core wooden door, a real wood door frame, and still made a big dent in the top side of a horizontal steel support beam in the basement. That's 4 sheets of sheetrock, a 2x4 stud, some wooden door trim, two sheets of plywood flooring, and a hollow core door and still dimpled a steel beam. Normal AK ammo is way overpowered for home defense use, in my opinion, unless you live alone in the middle of a vast plot of land or always shoot downward and don't mind shooting through multiple levels of house to get the bad guys.

View QuotePistol, PCC, and shotgun are all still problematic indoors: Wiscat Joined Jul 2014 Posts 304 EE 100% (18) WI, USA Posted: 5/10/2017 10:58:25 AM EDT I am a carpenter by trade and built some shoot through walls for my dads PD to test their carry ammo. (Some time ago; non formal testing). Drywall, siding, insulation, studs and masonry. After seeing their results I would be much more comfortable using a soft HP or tipped bullet out of a ak than a pistol or shotgun. 00 buck, #4 buck, and 230gr Gold dot(45ACP) will likleyvmake it out of your house, no problem. These rounds were worse than .556 ball and even 308GM OTM rounds. The most surprising was the 230gr GD. It would fill up an penetrate with very little divergence. I think a shotgun or pistol is greatly overblown in HD roles. Any round you fire your house cannot be counted on to not penetrate. My children are young yet have been taught that if they hear glass break or my voice to hide under their beds. Their room is right next to master bedroom. And the fallback point. Rounds should be kept high; family members should be kept low. 1saxman Joined Feb 2003 Posts 7798 EE 100% (11) USA Posted: 5/10/2017 3:43:11 PM EDT I have ammunition in case I decide to use the AK for HD but I do live in a traditional subdivision. I normally figure on using pistols or a pistol caliber carbine (.40). My HD AK ammo is either Tula 154 gr SP or PPU 123 gr round-nose soft point. My AK for this purpose is an AMD 65 with 11 1/2" barrel so velocities are going to be lower than a 16". Still, this is 'big medicine' for anybody or anything coming through the door. I particularly like the PPU round-nose soft point - its shaped like a pistol bullet which should make it harder-hitting and less penetrating. The Tula 154gr Soft Point is slower to start with than regular 123gr ammo and the short barrel takes away more velocity, so really this one is probably technically the best for HD. I would use this in a 20" SKS for a hard-hitting hog/deer round.

The only source I know of for 8m3 is SGammo. Leukemia sucks.
