I've been holding on to it cause I've never seen it before. Anyone know anything about it? <a href="//secondmedia-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=e0561d51ee&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//secondmedia-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=273267&cs=e0561d51ee&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> elray wit whiz Joined May 2005 Posts 4158 EE 100% (370) FL, USA Posted: 3/26/2017 10:08:09 PM EDT Yes Years ago I shot a ton of it.

SI VIS PACEM PARA BELLUM 1saxman Joined Feb 2003 Posts 7787 EE 100% (11) USA Posted: 4/25/2017 8:48:12 AM EDT Not particularly collectible but it is the first commercial, pre-Wolf, non-corrosive steel-case imported from Russia. Notice the pains they take to make sure there is no mistake; 'L.C.B.' is 'lead core, boat tail'. The military steel-core had been banned and American shooters wanted non-corrosive. It is reliable ammo but not particularly accurate. I gave all I had left of it to my son when a relative gave him a NIB MAK 90. Its mainly what he takes to the range to this day. <a href="//secondmedia-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=e0561d51ee&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//secondmedia-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=273267&cs=e0561d51ee&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Anyone see this stuff before?
