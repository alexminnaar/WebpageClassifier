Oil Filter Advice Needed By bfurth · Posted 6 hours ago Use the Mopar filter for the 3.6 - there is nothing to be gained from using an aftermarket filter.  For my 2.4, I use the Purolator Boss PBL12222 (hey, I only change it once a year - leave me alone).

Oil Filter Advice Needed By 2late4u · Posted 17 hours ago here in Alabama the local walmart doesn't carry fram oil filters for the journey, also they dont  have any listing for the the battery size for the journey either, went to buy one and they said nope we dont list them so i told them the battery  group # and he said well we have that one but it would come without a warranty i just laughed at him and walked away, but as jkeaton said i to have used fram all my life in all my cars and never had a problem with them..... Oil Filter Advice Needed By jkeaton · Posted 18 hours ago   No need to pay a premium price for an overhyped filter when there are other options. Oil filters are oil  filters. Change your oil at the recommended intervals and use the filter of your choice.  Been following that logic for over 40 years now. Never had an issue.  Oil Filter Advice Needed By 2late4u · Posted yesterday at 02:03 PM why not use the mopar filter from the dealership, only cost me about $8. each?? that way there is no question if something goes wrong....
