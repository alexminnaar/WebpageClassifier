In online-shopping coupon or promo code is a unique combination of letters or numbers that users can enter into specific field on the website’s shopping cart checkout page in order to get a discount on their purchase, free delivery or some gifts with their order. Online stores offer coupons for free as a motivation for shoppers to purchase from their websites. Usually most coupons have a limited time period starting from a few days to several weeks. Some online merchants offer their coupons directly on their own website, but most use well-known affiliate programmes or send their promo codes via email newsletter. Discounts can reach up to a half of initial cost price and can be a very great offer. Many shops distribute special coupon codes via e-mailing them to the partner sites and loyal clients free of charge. To get the coupon code at ILoveBargain use the “Search” option and head to the deals of the shop you've selected. Here you can find fresh and up-to-date promotions and codes. Pick the discount which suits your order the best. Copy the coupon code and use it when you make a purchase at the online-shop. Sometimes, several codes may be applied simultaneously but usually only 1 coupon code will work for your order. After using the “Search” field, you will proceed to the web-page where all the deals and codes for the certain shop are gathered. As soon as you've picked the discount offer which suits you the best, press the button “Show Code” and copy a special combination that will appear in the new window. The coupon is used during the Checkout on the shop's web-site. For choice, a special field for the coupon can usually be found at the Cart next to Total Sum of the product/products you have selected. After the application of the promo code your total sum will be re-calculated automatically or you will see the free gift or free delivery option. If for any reason the promo code has not applied, try to use another codes offered at ILoveBargain for this very shop. © 2017 ILoveBargain Singapore.
