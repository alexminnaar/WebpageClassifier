Clouds and lightning circled us in the distance, but we were not met by a storm. Fifteen teams fished. There were 6 limits. The winners, the team of Weisshaar and Krisher, smoked the rest of the field with a winning weight of 24.46 # and big fish of 9.27#. Second place went to the husband/wife team of Redding and Redding with 12.72#. Third place was the team of Tucker and Miller with 11.88 # and second big fish of 4.79#. Most of the reports were that the bite really slowed at dusk. Fish were caught both up the river and main lake. Winning presentations included drop shot, crankbaits, and senko. The lake was brownish with scattered dead shad almost everywhere due to the golden algae. However, only one dead game fish was observed. Our next tournament is a day tournament at Apache Lake September 16. See our website for any updates including the pre-tournament meeting set for 7 pm on Monday 9/ 11. 1 Reply | 53 Views MBC Summer Nights Tournament Results Aug 14, 2017 - 10:03 AM - by MBC-Info The results for the Fourth and final 2017 Summer Nights tournaments being held at Bartlett Lake have been posted.
