Our motivation in creating this website is to emphasize and support a dying breed of old-school race bikes. We hope to help promote the style and keep alive the nostalgia of these great bikes and the era from which they were born. We will be keeping an eye on the vintage racing scene. Our local track, New Hampshire International Speedway hosts numerous races for the USCRA and we will be expanding the number of tracks we cover in the near future. On our site, we will be posting dates for races and local swap meet events. We hope you enjoy our site and look forward to your participation.
