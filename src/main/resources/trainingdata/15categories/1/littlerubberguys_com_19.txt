Posted 06 March 2016 - 11:25 AM I've been meaning to share this with you guys for awhile now! For all of us bummed about the temporary hold on weapons: Use LEGO weapons! They fit in the hands of the Rhino nicely. (And it will likely be cheaper than outfitting them with vintage BB weapons.)

These would be awesome little dudes sitting on my shelf, glowing in all their glory. Really wanted that kickstarter glow pack release with all 6 figures.

The ROTB guys have nice grippy mitts, like the originals. I'll send you an awesome picture!HA! I hear that. All the Glyos too. And original BB. I'm too cheap to outfit all the BB with original weapons. Some accessories even look better than the originals imo. Honestly couldn't tell you where half of the weapons come from. They are cool though. Some certainly fit better than others. And wow! What a spaz. 2nd pic, first weapon is an accessory I have been after for several years, scouring ebay and the like. Glad you said something Tiny. And Draz for that matter. Probably been in my possession since I owned the figure.

It's far to cold in here for this hot toyline!! I hear ya. I'm bummed the kickstarter didn't reach. I was stoked on the glow editions that were going to be produced. Is it likely we will still see the glow editions? I certainly hope so. Would it be worth trying another kickstarter campaign? Maybe a new platform or restructured. Possibly one that has a larger focus on new characters and less on weapons? I was very surprised it didn't make it last time and find it difficult to believe that there is not enough people out there to make this happen. How could we get more and (maybe more importantly) new people interested who might not be familiar with the line? I'm not a big social media person but feel this would be a big asset in doing so. Maybe more of a buzz surrounding facebook groups could be created? Get it going on instagram? I'm not really sure how that works but I think it's clear that a larger following would help. I think it's important to find new outlets to inform people of the line, I'm just not sure what they are or how that would be executed.

Work has been really busy the last few months. I'm hoping it will ease up after June and I can get going on this again. We have definitely picked up some more fans since the KS though. I have had quite a few new orders come in recently for these guys. I'll keep you posted when things start rolling along again. 1 LittleRubberGuys Store O.M.F.G.

That would be a terrible shame it had such potential and fantastic sculpts .I loved the concept and would have liked to see it taken farther even if it was only conceptual art of what might have been . 0 Back to top #95 jkaris jkaris AKIA Site Owner Y/S*N*T Little Rubber Guys 22230 posts Gender:Male Location:West Sacramento, CA Posted 12 July 2017 - 08:19 AM No. Not dead by any stretch, but free time is the road block right now. I have been way too busy this last year and a half (new duties at work, home remodel, two graduating kids, etc) to move anything forward. I was hoping to have a partial release this year (weapons pack and some GitD figures), but that isn't going to happen now. Things should start winding down in the next few months, so I will have time to re-focus on RotB then. I am looking at 2018 now for the next batch. 2 LittleRubberGuys Store O.M.F.G.

I found this line based on battle beasts to be far superior in feature and design to the other released by mini-mates or Tomy beast saga lines and look forward to seeing it continue . You've done a great job thank you again . 1 Back to top « Prev Page 4 of 4 2 3 4 Back to Rise of the Beasts Reply to quoted posts     Clear     LittleRubberGuys.com Forums → Little Rubber Guys Board → Rise of the Beasts Privacy Policy Change Theme IP.Board IP.Board Mobile IBR Caja Help Community Forum Software by IP.Board 3.4.4 Copyright © 2017 LittleRubberGuys.com   Sign In Need an account?
