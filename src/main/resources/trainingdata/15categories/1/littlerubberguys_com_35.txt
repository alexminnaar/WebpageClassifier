If you are actively trying to complete a flesh/master set please respond with which one your are working on and how many figures you have left. And it might be cool to know how many people have completed their goal and have a full flesh set (does anyone actually have a master set done, I don't think so??). So if you have a full flesh set, please post up that you are an official member of the 236 club.

I know there are many many more people on here with full flesh sets, since I have traded to probably a dozen folks who were within 20 figs last I talked with them.  I know I got the final figure needed to at least 2 people, so hopefully we get some more responses.   I am really jonesing to see how many brave people in in the 1000+ category of the Master Set.   Edited by OneTallPonderosa, 14 February 2017 - 10:18 PM. 0 Check out my want list: http://www.littlerub...howtopic=251821 Check out my have list: http://www.littlerub...howtopic=251730 Check out my LEGOs:http://www.littlerub...howtopic=251230 Check out my trading Contest #3: http://www.littlerub...916#entry673886   LETS MAKE A DEAL!

My dream set consist of all Sunshine sculpts, all Sunigator sculpts, muscle man #1, and Haniwa Satan. I am missing 4 figures and my dream set will be completed. I also collect Satan cross flesh figures, muscle or kinkeshi. With the Satan Cross set I am missing 8 figures, one of them being a custom that I like a lot, and I'm also missing muscle version satan cross sealed in 10 pack can.
