Posted 29 July 2015 - 01:17 PM Hi guys,   i'm looking for a neat Gamoja checklist or backcard, in order to see each figure and read his name. The only ones i've found are small & blurry.   Thanks !

Posted 21 August 2016 - 07:07 PM A year+ later and still looking! That's rough! I bought a pack or two of these sealed years ago. I wish I had've known/had the foresight to check to see the scarcity of this because I could've done a better scan of the card.

Posted 15 September 2016 - 07:14 PM This is the best I could do for you lol Someone posted a picture online with a lot of toys and I edited/resized the picture a bit on photoshop (you should open the picture on photoshop, paint or a similar program with a "zoom in" tool just in case its still hard to read for you). Sadly the person who took the picture had some of the figures on top of the checklist, so a few names can't be seen. If I get my hands on a better picture I'll let you know.    GamojaChecklist.jpg   278.66K   30 downloads   Original Picture  13959357462_8197ec1734_o.jpg   185.18K   29 downloads 1 Back to top #5 trumanshower trumanshower Eternal Truman of the spotless mind Members 1308 posts Gender:Male Location:Lille, France Interests:dragonautes, monster in my pocket, fistful of power, motu, cosmix, luxioles etc etc...

I'm trying to add a checklist to my free iOS app (Toy Collector Checklist 3 - http://bit.ly/toycapp3) and a list with names and rarity would be very helpful!   Thanks, Zack 0 Back to top #7 trumanshower trumanshower Eternal Truman of the spotless mind Members 1308 posts Gender:Male Location:Lille, France Interests:dragonautes, monster in my pocket, fistful of power, motu, cosmix, luxioles etc etc...
