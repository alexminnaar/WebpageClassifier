This provides your Off Road Beast with an aggressive stance that these vehicles demand. The second is your more street friendly vehicle that you want to give that stylish look to set it apart from all other vehicles. The wheels offset is more positive and will still allow you to use it on your vehicle with a mild lift or stock appearance. The wheels come in a variety of 17", 18", 20" 22" and 24" sizes in a variety of finishes - Gloss Gunmental, Matte Black w/Machine Face & Dark Matte Tint, Matte Black w/Matte Graphite Lip, Matte Black, Gloss Black with Machine, Matte Black with Matte Machine, 5, 6 and 8 Lug, all depending on what perfectly suits your Truck or SUV.
