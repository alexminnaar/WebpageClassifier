Roadkill Nights Powered by Dodge is back, and yes, there were be drag racing, car shows, thrill rides, dyno tests, and lots of Freiburger and Finnegan and Mike Musto and Roadkill cars. Also, come see the new Dodge Demon. That’s one of the benefits to being friends with Tim Kuniskis, Head of Passenger Cars, Dodge, SRT, Chrysler and FIAT – FCA, North America. His powers are as massive as his title, and he might let us drive an 840hp Demon for your entertainment. ***REGISTER HERE*** If you missed Roadkill Nights last year, it was truly insane, with six-second drag cars spinning tires from stoplight to stoplight. If you that doesn’t give you some idea of the barely-legal feel of the night, how about this: We kept having to hold the drag races whenever the train was going through the staging lanes. And it’s back, so you don’t have to miss out again. Registration is now open for Roadkill Nights–which drew in 30,000-plus fans last year. Spectators will pay $10 per person—$5 per person for Pontiac residents ($5 price available on-site only)—and children 12 and under are free. Stay tuned for registration details for the drag racing component; we have an exciting revised format we will be releasing information on shortly! Roadkill Nights powered by Dodge! It’s August 12th in Pontiac, Michigan, with racing on Woodward Avenue! Waiting for Drag Race sign-ups? Here’s the plan: Quickly check out our drag racing application here to register. You’ll have 7 days to send in your photos and reasons why you need to race on Woodward Ave. If you’re picked, you’ll get a code and link to enter the race. It’s gonna be wild. If you don’t want to race, take a Dodge Thrill Ride, breathe in the cacklefest fumes, marvel at the wheelstander exhibition runs, test your car against a dyno, or just park at the show ‘n’ shine, and go watch the action. There will be plenty of family-friendly activities including bouncy inflatables and face-painting, an entertainment stage; and an eclectic offering of food and beverages, including that Roadkill rescue-from-family-friendly-activities beverage: beer. Roadkill Nights Powered By Dodge will also include a first-ever celebrity showdown with plans for David Freiburger, Mike Finnegan, Leah Pritchett, Matt Hagan, and Mike Musto to get behind the wheel. Leading the races will be Freiburger and Finnegan, “Roadkill Nights brings ROADKILL to life and allows our fans to participate,” says Freiburger.

Today, I bring you a look at the differences between the two which you cannot see by reading a fact sheet. The media drive event in Indianapolis began with driving the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Widebody on the F1 Grand Prix course of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, followed by an hour-long cruise in a Widebody Hellcat to Indianapolis Raceway Park, where we would test the new Dodge Challenger SRT Demon on the quarter mile drag strip. IRP would also serve as the base of operations for the Demon on-road drive as well, so over the course of 9 hours, I drove the new Widebody Hellcat and the new Demon on the road and on the track. The facts on both cars make it pretty clear that these two cars have different goals. The Challenger SRT Demon is built for drag strip dominance without compromising the ability to drive the car every warm, sunny day. The Challenger SRT Hellcat Widebody is a beast on the drag strip, but this model is more of an all-around muscle car, with the wider tires making the car better on the drag strip and the road course. Mind you, the Widebody Hellcat isn’t intended to be a road course warrior like the Shelby GT350R Mustang but rather, the wider tires improving handling and acceleration capabilities a bit, making it an all-around better performance car. However, facts and marketing aside, how does the Demon differ from the Widebody Hellcat? Here is a quick rundown. Demon is Faster, Of Course The new Demon offers 840 horsepower and 770lb-ft of torque when running on 100 octane race gas while the Hellcat Challenger “only” delivers 707 horsepower and 650lb-ft of torque. It is easy to say “the Demon has 133 more horsepower and 120lb-ft more torque”, but it is shocking just how much of a difference that added power makes. The Hellcat Challenger pulls hard through the midrange once traction has been achieved – harder than pretty much any car sold in America – but the Demon’s midrange pull is nothing short of breathtaking. The Hellcat pins you to your seat at peak power; the Demon pins you to the seat and continues to apply force that you can feel through your torso throughout a quarter mile run like nothing I have ever experienced from a street car. In the video below, I laid down a 10.5 at 132 miles per hour with the new Demon on just my 6th run. In short, the new Demon’s power advantage over the Hellcat makes a remarkable difference in acceleration forces throughout the powerband, but it is easiest to feel that difference in the midrange and into the higher RPM. Demon Launches like Nothing Else At the Demon/Widebody Hellcat media drive event, we did not go drag racing in the 707hp Challenger, but I did perform a few hard launches on pit road of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to get a feel for how the wider tires of the Widebody car improve traction. I have made a great many 8th mile and quarter mile runs in the Hellcat cars and I can say without question that traction on a hard launch is noticeably better with the new 305mm-wide rear tires of the Widebody package. When launching a Hellcat Challenger on stock Pirelli rubber, you basically have to ease the car through all of first gear and much of second gear before you are able to put the right pedal all of the way to the floor. Rolling into the throttle too early with the Hellcat can lead to a rolling burnout which will continue through the shift and into second gear, unless you lift enough to settle the tires down. On the other hand, the Demon’s traction abilities are nothing short of world class. Between the trick suspension tune, the factory-equipped drag radial tires, the TransBrake and the new Torque Reserve system, the Demon not only launches with far more power than the Hellcat, but the power is...
