Click to expand... If GWS at Spotless is sold out then perhaps it should have been at the SCG. But the AFL don't expect a sell out. So why move it to the SCG? And 10 oppo supporters are worth at least 1 GWS supporter to the AFL. And any Sydney supporter who cares can get a seat at Spotless. And any interstate supporter who carers can get a seat at Spotless.

Why would the AFL even consider a game there, they want to maximise crowds and money. Last time we had a final in Geelong, there were 4 first round finals games in Victoria, 3 at the G, 1 in Geelong. The cats also lost this game. The Giants having a final at the SCG could hurt their brand. They are trying to be a team for Western Sydney. Playing at Spotless right now in their short history is the best thing for the club. If it is a sellout, so be it. If they play the Swans. Well, it would have to be ANZ Stadium.   Greenstar5, Aug 22, 2017 at 9:36 PM #12 Reply Heardy_101, Vintage, van peebles and 3 others like this.

I would say surely they'd move it to ANZ (if Richmond were to play GWS), but ANZ is not listed as a finals venue..... They'd have to play a GWS vs Sydney final there there.... Spotless is way too small and SCG would barely fit everyone in....   Glenno23, Aug 22, 2017 at 9:39 PM #14 Reply Heardy_101 and evo like this.

Or they're hoping Richmond lose on Sunday and end up hosting Melbourne or Essendon at the G...97-98k for an elimination final is nothing to sneeze at. For the record and just to make sure I haven't jinxed Richmond with the above statement...please beat st Kilda on Sunday.   joelsyt, Aug 22, 2017 at 9:48 PM #20 Reply Heardy_101, BotsMaster and PetterdHoisted like this. evo Brownlow Medallist Richmond Other teams: Joined: Oct 03 Posts: 25,134 Location: I'm a pickle LukeParkerno1 said: ↑ Then here's an idea- get in early.

Duskfire Norm Smith Medallist Geelong Other teams: Joined: Jun 07 Posts: 5,157 Location: Perth Geelong play 2 home games at MCG throughout the year, and all of a sudden because it's finals they need to play another one even if they earnt a home final. North has more home games at Blundstone! I remember when interstate teams were forced to play at the MCG some years - Brisbane had to do it in 04 against Geelong, and I remember west coast having to do it against Essendon at some point. That sucked massively, and it sucks now. It's not about distance, it's about having home ground advantage. Geelong doesn't have that at the MCG.   Duskfire, Aug 22, 2017 at 9:55 PM #25 Reply Heardy_101, azyboy, dazbroncos and 2 others like this. (You must log in or sign up to reply here.)
