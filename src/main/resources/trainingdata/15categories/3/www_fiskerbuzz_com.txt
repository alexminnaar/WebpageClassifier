After releasing several teaser images, Fisker Inc. has shown off the new EMotion that is claiming to be the first all-electric luxury sedan to boast a 400-mile (640 kilometers) range. Sporting new styles and proportions for the luxury sedan segment, the EMotion features a sculptural body and “greenhouse emphasizing aerodynamics,” said the American automaker. Up front is a large, curved windshield similar to what’s seen on the Tesla Model X, while the rear boasts an integrated spoiler and aggressive functional diffuser to support aerodynamics.

It also has adaptive LED headlights and doesn’t have a front grille, similar to current Tesla models.

Earlier this week, Fisker tweeted a teaser image showing off the butterfly doors that will be used on his new car and it seemingly drummed up a good amount of buzz on the internet. But a report from The Truth About Cars claims that many of those comments are being posted by an Indian social media firm that is being paid to bolster Fisker’s reputation online. The investigation began when TTAC noticed some interesting comments on its website, a number of which were submitted within an hour of one another and all that praised the design of Fisker’s new car. With some digging, the site discovered that all three comments were submitted using notmailinator.com email addresses, and all three accounts were consistent in using a first and last name in the email.
