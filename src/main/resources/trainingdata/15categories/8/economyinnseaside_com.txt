Economy Inn Seaside ↓ Skip to Main Content Economy Inn Home Economy Inn Seaside 1131 Fremont St, Seaside, CA 93955 Seaside, located just 5 miles from the bustle of downtown Monterey, is a compelling destination in its own right. It’s the home of California State University’s Monterey Bay campus, and as such a youthful, cosmopolitan vibe permeates its streets. The compact town center plays host to an ever-increasing choice of hip cafes, cozy dive bars, and restaurants. Seaside is also the gateway to Fort Ord, a naturally spectacular former US Army post which is now a designated National Monument. With wildflower-strewn hillsides and over 80 miles of blissfully unspoiled trails, it’s sheer heaven for hikers, horse riders, and mountain bikers.
