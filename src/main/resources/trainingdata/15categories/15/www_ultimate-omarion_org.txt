Shot in Japan by Duc John. Share this: Email Facebook Twitter Google Tumblr LinkedIn CATEGORIES HERE  Media Jul 07 2017 U-OMARION.ORG AUTHOR: Semmie COMMENTS: NO COMMENTS [Official Music Video] Omarion – W4W “Word 4 Word” When last we saw Omarion he was working, stretching his voice to the limits to cover Earth, Wind, and Fire’s “Reasons.” Almost a month later, he’s still working, this time on the video for “Word for Word,” the latest single from his upcoming album “Reasons”. “Over the last three or four days I’ve been editing a mini-movie,” Omarion told Complex. The visual album is in vogue right now, thanks to Beyoncé, but Omarion’s passion for the visual supplement to soul-stirring music goes back longer than that. “I’m a living, breathing child of one of the greatest to ever do it, Michael Jackson,” he said. The 32-year-old performer has logged enough hours by now, working on films like You Got Served, that he feels comfortable commanding the editing suite himself. “I’ve been in the edit for the last couple of days, and it’s been by far the longest edit I’ve ever had to do.” The shoot for “Word for Word,” which premieres on Friday, July 7, took Omarion to Japan, where he became fascinated with the martial art of kendo. The practices uses bamboo swords, both as a means to develop combat technique and foster discipline of character—something Omarion felt particularly connected to. “They have masters in kendo, called a dan, and the highest level is like a dan ten,” he said. “But you can’t even really start to become a dan until you’re like 40 years old. And it teaches you about yourself. The strikes are personal; a strike is supposed to reflect who you are as a person. Some of that culture is in the video and it mirrors the lyrics of ‘Word for Word.’ ” What about the album “Reasons” ? But Reasons is still without a firm release date. “We’re talking about the record business and business is complicated,” he said. “I’ve never truly been concerned about the opinions of executives, because my art and creativity is meant to be shared with people who want it. I hope that when it comes out, it gets its proper time.” “But the fans have the power,” he continued, “so I do need people who appreciate the music to share it. This is not new news, but no one had control over ‘Post to Be.’ It took six months for ‘Post to Be,’ and the fans made it happen. So it’s about us finding our rhythm, me and my fans.” Share this: Email Facebook Twitter Google Tumblr LinkedIn CATEGORIES HERE  Featured, Media, Music videos Jun 19 2017 U-OMARION.ORG AUTHOR: Semmie COMMENTS: NO COMMENTS Omarion Premieres His Cover Of Earth, Wind & Fire’s “Reasons” Remaking a beloved song is ambitious to say the least and Omari Grandberry did the damn thang and paid homage at the same time when he covered the legendary Earth, Wind, and Fire’s love ballad, “Reasons.” The Love & Hip Hop Hollywood star promised fans an album which was supposed to be released last friday and although he didn’t deliver “Reasons” he blessed us with the single of the same name instead. (So technically, he didn’t break any promises.) Granted, it takes bravery for anyone to take on such a valiant task as remaking a legendary song. Hitting those falsetto notes, Omarion soulfully sings as Philip Bailey successfully did back in 1975. For those fans waiting on Reasons, the album, Omarion said, “My album is mastered and it’s ready to release. But the record company doesn’t want to release it because they don’t see the demand. I want the fans to know that they can demand it, and one way is by showing support for ‘Distance’ by streaming and downloading it, and following me on all social media platforms.” Share this: Email Facebook Twitter Google Tumblr LinkedIn CATEGORIES HERE  Featured, Media, Music videos Jun 15 2017 U-OMARION.ORG AUTHOR: Semmie COMMENTS: NO COMMENTS [PHOTOS + VIDEO] Omarion LIVE at the Ngong RaceCourse in Nairobi, Kenya – June 3 The Afro pop concert hosted by Shaffie Weru alongside Amina Abdi and headlined by American R n’ B artiste Omarion was the place to be on June 3.

Omarion – When You Say Jay 305 takes us back to a more simpler time on his latest record “When You Say.” The South Central L.A. rapper hops on Teena Marie’s classic hit “Ooo La La” and entices all the ladies with his blunt, pick-up bars. OPM’s rising star really isn’t trying to say the L-word, but he won’t trip if his potential hook-up plays herself by falling hard for him. MMG’s Omarion hops on the record produced by Cardo to do what he does best on the hook. “When You Say” comes shortly after dropping his NSFW video for “Yuck It Up.” No word on where this sexy banger will end up but the single will be available in full at midnight tonight.
