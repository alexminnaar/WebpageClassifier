Z Assists: Call your team mate for covering fire! Z Change: Switch with another team mate! Ki Charge: Hold down to charge your Energy Gauge! Sparking Blast: Increase Your power for a limited time! And also recover your health gauge (Once during one match) Vanish: Move instantly behind the opponent and land an attack! (Uses 1 Gauge) Ultimate Z Change: Launch a Super Attack with your team members (Uses 1 Gauge) Is this like the Xenoverse game ? No, this is 2.5D, that means it is on the same plane as "Street Fighter" or "Injustice 2". Are those 2D sprites or 3D models ? The technology and technique used by Arcsystem works, makes full use of 3D models and specific shaders while limiting the animation frames to mimic the look and style of Anime. The result is awe inspiring ! Can a 2D game feel like DBZ ? Of course, Dragon Ball FighterZ includes a lot of mechanics that directly evoke DBZ. You can teleport at any moment, dash at your enemy at full speed, or eject them into the air before unleashing a devastating combo. On top of that, you can send the enemy flying into buildings or destroy half the planet if you wish to !!! I heard the characters play the same, does this lack depth ? This is a misinterpretation of what was said by Youtuber Maximilian. The characters all have universal abilities (teleport, homing dash, rush, etc...), therefore, they can all do a combo into a launcher, and then into an air combo and a super move. This isn't exclusive to Dragon Ball FighterZ, and is the case in many fighting games. The characters all have different optimal combos, and ways to open up the enemy. On top of that, the synergy of your team and how to use your assists to make your character abilities shine adds a lot of depth into the game. The characters shown so far are characters that have similar fighting style in the show (Cel,l Gohan, Goku, Vegeta), Frieza and Buu were relatively different. How many characters can we expect ? It takes a lot of time to make those characters. So it won't have a huge roster. You can expect at the very least 18 characters, and 30 at most. So a realistic expectation, would be anywhere from 21 to 24. The game has auto combos, how does that work ? Just like Persona 4 Arena and the new Marvel Infinite, the game features auto combos if you mash light or medium attacks. Those combos are never optimal and are only there for people who have trouble making their own combos. They deal less damage than normal combos. For players that want to take things more seriously, those combos are never used. We do not know as of now if you can turn off those auto combos entirely. Will the game feature GT and Super characters ? The team is listening to feedback. It is likely Super characters will have some presence. It's possible future GT and Super characters are added through DLC. Thanks to Slaythe and Kagari for putting the thread together! Last edited by Crazy Diamond; Today at 04:17 PM.

Nah, not likely. If Slaythe is right, there will likely only be two Gokus to worry about (unless Goku Black is also a thing, but he doesn't reallyeven fight like Goku does). The SSJ form that we've seen and his Blue form that's likely going to be just as different Order Sol was to Sol.

Bardock instead of Raditz. Take out Nappa (SSJ Goku and Vegeta seem to be their default, so I doubt the game will cover the Saiyan Saga) and Hercule.

No Super hopefully Super Buu did so much damage in Z (killed everyone) (What other character did this) You can't have 18 without 17 Bardock okay Nappa is iconic in the series and pretty well known due to memes and Team4Star but I like him over any Super characters or used character slots for Hair changes Okay if one Super character makes it ..

SSB and Kid Buu will likely be similar to Installs. Only Super characters I see in the base game are Golden Freeza, Beerus, SSB Goku and SSB Vegeta. All the other Super characters will be DLC or for the sequel where they can go all out with the series. cordy View Public Profile Send a private message to cordy Find More Posts by cordy Solid Sora Member (06-15-2017, 12:08 AM) Quote #36 My current guesses for the roster: 1) Goku 1.1) Goku Blue 2) Vegeta 2.2) Vegeta Blue 3) Gohan 4) Ultimate Gohan 5) Future Trunks (Ikari install) 6) Vegito (Blue install) 7) Krillin 8) Piccolo 9) Gotenks (SSJ3 install) 10) Freeza (Golden install) 11) Cell 12) Majin Buu 13) Kid Buu 14) Android 18 15) Beerus 16) Hit 17) Merged Zamasu (Final Boss) 18) Broly 19) Bardock I feel like every character on this list is 100% guaranteed to be in. They amount to 19 characters + 2 clones.. which seems reasonable by Arc standards. If they decided to up the roster to 24 characters, I think those with highest chances to be in are: 20) Android 16 21) Android 17 22) Master Roshi 23) Tien 24) Yamcha (Joke character) Other possibilities can be Captain Ginyu, Raditz, or Nappa. I hope none of them are in though. for the DLCs, I think we're getting Black, Caulifla, Kale, and Jiren. That would be perfect for Super representation.

Golden Frieza is in this and was in Extreme Butoden, and though he's technically part of the canon DBZ movies I imagine ArcSys will want to go further than the roster they had in their previous DBZ game. Goku Black would have been the talk of the town when they were putting the roster for this game together. Super Buu did a lot, sure, but he'd be the third Buu in the game (surely Kid Buu would get in). That and his movelist would require his absorptions, and I'm not sure how they'd handle that. His exclusion would leave Gotenks in a weird place though. You can have 18 without 17. ArcSys have done it before. And Nappa - as I said it seems like Super Saiyan Goku and Vegeta are the default. If that's the case I don't expect Nappa or Raditz, but the game to skip representing the Saiyan saga entirely. Last edited by Alienous; 06-15-2017 at 12:12 AM.
