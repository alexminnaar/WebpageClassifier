(I like Silver Ice, but I really wanted Splash.  My significant other didn't.  Some of the other colors (e.g., Toasted Marshmallow) just didn't work for me. I couldn't find much reliability data on the Spark, but given that it's built by GM Korea, I'm hoping it'll hold up.  Fingers crossed.  2016 Spark front end noise By Bobby MSME · Posted 7 hours ago CV (Constant Velocity) joints are necessary to allow front wheels to run at slightly different speeds. This is because during a turn, the turning radius of each wheel will be different. When going straight, the CV joints are static with little or no wear. When turning with power, there will be wear. I try to turn at the lowest possible speed and power to minimize CV joint wear. Consequently I never had issues with CV joints on many front wheel drive cars I have owned and driven. I have not noticed any undue noise on my 2017 LS CVT under any circumstance. 2016 Chevy Spark Color Photos By Bobby MSME · Posted 7 hours ago Personal Efficiency Tips By Bobby MSME · Posted 7 hours ago Personal Efficiency Tips By Goldfish55 · Posted 16 hours ago I got a 2016 spark LT, not 2LT, and noticed the AC was cold but couldn't keep up with the black interior and HUGE windows. I got the window tint and immediately noticed a difference. It looks a little better but the AC definitely doesn't have to work nearly as hard because of the tint block and reflecting a lot of light. Eventually it started making the mileage go up too because i didn't need full blast AC all the time. I also learned that the recirculation button makes worlds of difference for both heat and AC. I also noticed when the temperature drops below 32F the cars mileage drops big time. If you get a black "bra" or whatever you wish to call it, it makes a big difference. So long as it is black nobody will notice it and it took my mileage from 38mpg back up to 42. BUT be very careful because blocking too much air could cause real problems. From my research when it's that cold you can cover up to 75% of the grill with no problems at all but because I'm cautious I covered 1/3 and still had a big gain. Also, the 35 psi rating for those tires is far too low. At traveling temperatures those tires should be 40-42 psi and 38 cold. At 35psi warm the tires are sagging under weight alone. These are just my findings and by no means an expert. Be careful with anything you do obviously but what all have you done? I'm curios to see what else people have tried that I haven't thought of (besides driving 55mph all the time).  2016 Chevy Spark Color Photos By Goldfish55 · Posted 16 hours ago I got splash and love it. Plus splash is metallic so with a little wax it really looks sharp.  2016 Spark front end noise By Goldfish55 · Posted 16 hours ago Mine makes the noise when making tight turns under some power. Turns out mine was the differential (or so I was told) might have this looked into, thank you! New Owner, Super-Base Model By Goldfish55 · Posted 16 hours ago Absolutely loving the fact that people race these things. Fantastic. Since the 98 hp is WAAAAAY under what the block is capable of I'd love to see how long they'll last racing. They use the same engine (with a turbo) in the Cruze, sonic, and Buick Encore all of which are significantly heavier. I'd like to see how people do in their classes racing since under 100hp and only 2200 lbs makes it a weak class.  Topics 0 Just bought 2017 Spark LT with CVT By ArlSparkLT Started 3 hours ago 10 2016 Spark front end noise By Rya Started August 9, 2016 11 2016 Chevy Spark Color Photos By robertlane Started July 11, 2016 1 Personal Efficiency Tips By Goldfish55 Started 16 hours ago 7 New Owner, Super-Base Model By GammaRadiation Started June 11, 2016 7 Had my new wheels installed By finklejag Started April 6 2 2016 cvt trans isue By cust1988 Started March 26 18 Who Has the Most miles on a 2016 Spark?
