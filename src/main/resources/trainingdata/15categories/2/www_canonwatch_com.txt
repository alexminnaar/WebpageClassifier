Compared to its predecessor, Canon has increased the still image quality significantly with higher resolution and wider dynamic range, while the autofocus has become more sensitive. The video function is also much more advanced with quality 4K recording and fast autofocus in live view mode. The Canon EOS 5D Mark IV also features the innovative new Dual Pixel Raw feature, which allows sharpness and background blur to be fine-tuned later. All in all, the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV will remain a class-leading camera for several years to come. EISA Consumer DSLR Camera 2017-2018: Canon EOS 77D The Canon EOS 77D adopts many key features from the semi-professional EOS 80D. The 24.2 million pixel CMOS-sensor achieves a better dynamic range than its predecessor. A big advantage is that the Dual Pixel CMOS AF that enables a very fast and smooth autofocus during live view and video. Combined with STM or Nano USM lenses, the focus is very quiet. The viewfinder autofocus is also greatly improved, with 45 cross-type points. The new DIGIC 7 processor delivers enough power for fast continuous shooting (6 frames per second) and Full HD-video with high frame rates (1080/60p). The top place LCD and the quick control dial allow fast operation. Other modern features are the articulated touchscreen and Wi-Fi, which is accompanied by Bluetooth for easy access. EISA Professional DSLR Lens 2017-2018: Canon EF 16-35mm F2.8L III USM The Canon EF 16-35mm F2.8L III USM has been long awaited by many professional photographers and exceeds expectations. It’s better built than its predecessors and gives astounding sharpness over the entire image, even at its full opening of F2.8. At 16mm it outperforms many ultra-wide-angle prime lenses. Distortion is low, while the anti-reflective coating very effectively reduces ghosting and flare. The Canon EF 16-35mm F2.8L III USM is built for everyday professional use and delivers an image quality that will satisfy even the most demanding users.             Canon EOS 6D Mark II firmware update coming September 2017? August 17, 2017 Canon Rumors 10 Comments Tweet Share Plus one Canon EOS 6D Mark II: Amazon | B&H Photo | Digitalrev | eBay | Adorama | Canon USA EOS 6D Mark II at a glance: 26.2MP Full-Frame CMOS Sensor DIGIC 7 Image Processor 45-Point All-Cross Type AF System Full HD Video at 60 fps; Electronic IS 3.0″ Vari-Angle Touchscreen LCD Dual Pixel CMOS AF and Movie Servo AF Native ISO 40000, Expanded to ISO 102400 6.5 fps Shooting; Time-Lapse & HDR Movie Built-In GPS, Bluetooth, & Wi-Fi w/ NFC Dust and Water Resistant; SD Card Slot We have been told (thanks) that Canon will soon release a firmware update for the new Canon EOS 6D Mark II. I doubt the firmware update will solve the alleged issues concerning limited dynamic range and poor high ISO performance of the Canon EOS 6D Mark II, though I’ve been told that it will. Most likely it will be a bug fix. I have a hard time figuring out how a firmware update could solve what appears to be limits of the sensor itself, i.e. of the hardware. While it is true that you can correct some thing via software (firmware is software), I guess the limits of the 6D Mark II sensor are here to stay. It seems Canon did well in disappointing many reviewers and potential customers. The lack of 4K video likely is the most criticized aspect of the EOS 6D Mark II, followed by the supposedly “poor” sensor performance at high ISO settings and a somewhat reduced dynamic range at low ISO. One thing is sure: the firmware update will not bring 4K video to the EOS 6D Mark II.             Canon EF-S 35mm f/2.8 Macro IS STM reviewed by Photography Blog August 16, 2017 Canon Reviews 2 Comments Tweet Share Plus one Canon EF-S 35mm f/2.8 Macro IS STM at a glance: Standard macro prime designed for APS-C-format Canon DSLRs, this lens offers a 56mm equivalent focal length. One glass-molded aspherical element is featured in the optical design to control spherical aberrations and deliver a high degree of sharpness and clarity. Maximum 1:1 magnification and a minimum focusing distance of 5.1″ permits making life-size imagery of close-up subjects. Built-in front-facing Macro Lite LED can be used to produce additional illumination to subjects when working at close distances. The light can be configured to illuminate only the right or left side, or both sides, and the brightness can be adjusted in order to produce greater visual depth and reduce shadows caused by the close proximity of the lens to the subject. Hybrid IS image stabilization minimizes the appearance of camera shake for sharper imagery when shooting handheld. Lead-screw-type STM stepping motor offers fast, quiet, smooth, and accurate autofocus performance that is ideal for video recording as well as still shooting. Full-time manual focus mode (AF+MF) lets you instantly switch to manual focus control in AF mode for making fine-tuned adjustments. Rounded seven-blade diaphragm and bright f/2.8 maximum aperture help to render smooth and pleasing bokeh to benefit shallow depth of field imagery. One of the less talked about recent Canon lenses, the Canon EF-S 35mm f/2.8 Macro IS STM, got reviewed by Photography Blog. It’s a relatively inexpensive lens, it sells for $349 at Amazon US, and it seems it delivers for the bucks. From the conclusion: With a 35mm focal length giving you an equivalent of 56mm, it doubles up as an every day or walk around lens, giving you extra flexibility. Those who have a keen interest in macro photography will of course be particularly drawn towards it though. The addition of the inbuilt macro lights is great news for anybody who likes to shoot extremely closely, and certain subjects, such as jewellery really benefit from the direct source of light. Certainly, anybody who needs to regularly shoot product photography may find this lens to be particularly useful. Image quality is excellent, producing very sharp images with a high level of detail, as you would expect from a macro lens. Out of focus areas are also rendered very nicely, with attractive bokeh which would make this lens ideal for creating shallow depth of field shots – portraits would also be a good subject to shoot with it.  Canon EF-S 35mm f/2.8 Macro IS STM: Amazon | B&H Photo | Digitalrev | eBay | Adorama | Canon USA             Canon EOS 5D Mark IV deal – $2799 (reg. $3299, refurbished from Canon) August 16, 2017 Canon Deals 0 Comments Tweet Share Plus one Canon EOS 5D Mark IV at a glance: 30.4MP Full-Frame CMOS Sensor DIGIC 6+ Image Processor 3.2″ 1.62m-Dot Touchscreen LCD Monitor DCI 4K Video at 30 fps; 8.8MP Still Grab 61-Point High Density Reticular AF Native ISO 32000, Expanded to ISO 102400 Dual Pixel RAW; AF Area Select Button Dual Pixel CMOS AF and Movie Servo AF 7 fps Shooting; CF & SD Card Slots Built-In GPS and Wi-Fi with NFC Good deal for those looking out to get a discounted EOS 5D Mark IV, The Canon Direct Store has it in stock for $2,799.20.
