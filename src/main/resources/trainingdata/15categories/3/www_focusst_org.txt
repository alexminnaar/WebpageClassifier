From Russian meteors to Chinese firework factory explosions, the dash cam has become the darling of viral video entertainment. And is responsible for capturing an unfathomable amount of footage that, collectively, has garnered billions of views on the Internet. Thats amazing since the point of owning a dash cam is far different. Most people are more interested in the legal and safety benefits of driving with a dash cam than online entertainment royalties.

Ford has already announced the 2018 Focus RS will be offered in a limited edition model, but according to CarsDirect, it will start from $41,995 including destination. The substantial increase in its pricing isnt unjustified, however, as the AWD hatch does get plenty of additional standard equipment including a limited-slip differential, the RS2 package, voice-activated navigation, 19-inch wheels, carbon fiber interior trim, and a black roof.</span> <span lang="EN-US">Read more about the 2018 Ford Focus RS at AutoGuide.com.</span>   41 Replies | 5,483 Views Fathers Day Gift Guide: 5 Cool Presents Your Dad Actually Wants Jun 07, 2017 - 8:16 AM - by AutoGuide.com <span lang="EN-US"></span> <span lang="EN-US">Dads are pretty much impossible to shop for. My dad is picky, endlessly pragmatic, and pretty much already has everything he needs/wants, which makes buying him a present THE WORST. He doesnt need more Starbucks or Home Depot gift cards, and he doesnt wear ties anymore and doesnt need any more tools, so dont even bother. Instead, for this Fathers Day Gift Guide, I pretty much thought of things that we would enjoy, hoping our car enthusiast dads would enjoy them too because we have more in common than you think.</span> <span lang="EN-US">Read more about Father's Day Gifts at AutoGuide.com.</span>   0 Replies | 543 Views 2018 Ford Focus RS Gets Standard Limited-Slip Differential May 31, 2017 - 8:19 AM - by AutoGuide.com <span lang="EN-US"></span> <span lang="EN-US">The current generation Ford Focus RS is about to get a whole lot of extra traction, with the 2018 version set to feature a standard limited-slip differential. Limited to just 1,500 units in the U.S. and Canada, the entire crop of cars destined for North America will include a factory-fitted mechanical LSD up front to reduce wheel spin and improve cornering performance. Supplied by Quaife, the LSD will complement what is already a stellar drivetrain that includes a performance-tuned all-wheel drive system and active torque vectoring. The decision to fit the Focus RS with a limited-slip differential comes following feedback online, with the automaker claiming its team scoured owner forums and enthusiast websites before honing in on the in-demand feature.</span> <span lang="EN-US">Read more about the 2018 Ford Focus RS at AutoGuide.com.</span>   5 Replies | 1,143 Views 2017 Ford Focus ST: The Jalopnik Review May 17, 2017 - 3:42 AM - by ST2Focus by William Clavey, 16 May 2017 Yes, the Ford Focus ST is actually still around. Its the hot hatchback we love but faded into the shadows after its little sibling, the Fiesta ST, kicked its ass in the fun-per-dollar argument. It then totally lost everyones attention when the almighty Focus RS arrived and decimated everything. Its still damn good. (Full disclosure: Ford Canada prepped me a Focus ST so I could drive it for a week. The car was delivered clean with a full tank of gas. Upon my return, I was told something to the effect that a Focus RS press car was lying around in their garage for special occasions.*Im sure we can find a way to arrange that, now can we?) The sport-y-ish compact car segment is looking good these days with new entries like the Civic Si, Elantra Sport, Sentra Nismo, Golf GTI, and even the Subaru WRX. All of them offer new platforms, suspension tuning, and solid MPG. Does the ageing Focus ST still hold up? Im here to tell you that, yes, of course it does. Fords hot hatch remains the no-brainer car for any enthusiast who also happens to be a parent wanting to retain his or her illusion of freedom, or just a normal human being who likes to do normal human being things. What Is It? For the longest time, we North Americans would look at Fords European division and drool with envy as we watched Jeremy Clarkson hoon Sierra and Escort Cosworths on YouTube. Meanwhile, the only fast Ford we had to play with was the Mustang, or the Probe, but that thing was actually a Mazda, so it doesnt really count. As far as compact cars went, the only thing Dearborn had to offer was a cheaply built ****box Escort that didnt have much in the way of power. Or any sort of performance cred, for that matter. Hey, we had the Escort GT! Sigh. By the late 90s, Ford finally came to its senses by importing the Focus from Europe, a better built small car replacement to our lame Escort. Sadly, we were once again deprived of anything truly performance-focused and left...
