No problems with voicing his story. The AFL is a pretty stiff industry that is quite tightly managed, this kind of story is good to see. I wish people would be less controlled and pedestrian, and embrace the unique individuals in the game a bit more.   demondavey, Aug 19, 2017 at 7:00 AM #12 Reply The Wrecker, Obeanie1, F the Rest and 46 others like this. 00Stinger Duel Group 1 winner Melbourne Other teams: Liverpool & San Francisco 49ers Joined: May 07 Posts: 11,909 Location: @ HOME ******* Sent from my SM-G930F using Tapatalk   00Stinger, Aug 19, 2017 at 7:21 AM #13 Reply Theo X likes this.

There is absolutely no coincidences that football attracts a pretty predictable type of demographic.

Please breakdown what you mean by 'There is absolutely no coincidences that football attracts a pretty predictable type of demographic' in relation to racism. It seems you are saying if you are drawn to AFL then you are racist? Also, don't try and make it out that people are trying to shoot down a character of the game. Harry O is the biggest me monster football has seen since Wizcap. But at least Wizcap knew he was a bit of a joke n couldn't change the world. Harry O seems to think he enlightens people with what he says, like it's quite final and authoritative when he states an opinion.   LeppaMessiah, Aug 19, 2017 at 8:29 AM #22 Reply Lostsoul, domus, Twist_of_Lemon and 14 others like this.
