In 1921 Triumph acquired the Dawson Car Company and began building automobiles beginning with the 1.4L Triumph 10/20. In the 1930s they changed their name to the Triumph Car Company, and spun off the motorcycle division into its own company in 1936. Donald Healey was the Experimental Manager from 1934 until 1939, when T.W. Ward purchased the company and placed Healey in charge as general manager. The company produced several models including the Gloria and the Dolomite during this time. After WWII, the company merged with the Standard Motor Company to form Standard-Triumph and once again started automobile construction, building one of the most modern car assembly plants in the world in 1959 at Canley for the new Triumph Herald. The Standard-Triumph company was eventually bought in 1960 by Leyland Motors Ltd for the sum of £20 million. The last Triumph model was the Acclaim which was introduced in 1981. Many iconic British sports cars were produced by Triumph in the 1960s and 1970s, including: TR3 (1955-1957), TR3A (1957-1962) TR3B (1961-?) with 2,138cc inline 4 engine and all synchromesh transmission TR4 (1961-1965) with 2,138cc inline 4 engine, roll-up windows, full synchromesh, rack & pinion steering and optional hardtop with integral rollbar. TR4A (1965-1968) an evolution of the TR4, with updated chassis and independant rear suspension (IRS) TR5 (1967-1968) similar to the Michelotti TR4, but featuring a 2.5L straight 6 fuel injected (PI) engine developing ~150bhp that was carried forward into the TR6. Standard equipment included front disc brakes, independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering and a four speed gearbox. TR250 (1967-1968) identical to the TR5, except fitted with twin Zenith-Stromberg carburettors, delivering 111 bhp (81 kW). TR6 (1969-1976), the iconic TR sports car, with a 2498cc inline six-cylinder engine, carburetted for the US and featuring Lucas mechanical fuel injection for the home market. Featuring a four-speed manual transmission, optional overdrive, independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering, fifteen inch (381 mm) wheels and tires, pile carpet on floors and trunk/boot, bucket seats, disc brakes front, drum brakes in the rear. Frame construction. Spitfire (1962-1981), a classic and popular two-seater sports car designed by Michelotti that went through 5 revisions during its long run as Triumph's best selling sports car. TR7 (1975-1981) and TR8 (1978-1981) aka the "wedge", with a 1998cc inline 4 and 3528cc V8 respectively, the last cars produced by Triumph.
