Humanoid Figure, 2" tall, red/silver (Hasbro Air Raiders style) Started by replicant01 , Jun 16 2017 06:55 PM Please log in to reply 10 replies to this topic #1 replicant01 replicant01 Wet Behind The Ears Members 8 posts Posted 16 June 2017 - 06:55 PM '87 Hasbro marking on small of back of 1 of the 2 figures.  Other figure has no identification marking.   Recently picked this lot of figures up on Ebay.  Very familiar with the Air Raiders line, never seen this particular guy before.  Very similar in style, except for the molded gun in hand.  Spoke to the seller afterwards & he stated his uncle was a Hasbro employee & would regularly bring toys home.  Was looking for any possible info regarding this figure, if it's from another line, etc.  Can post additional pics if necessary (listing pics attached). Thanks in advance.
