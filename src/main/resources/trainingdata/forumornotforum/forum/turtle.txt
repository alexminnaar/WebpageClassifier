Recently I discovered that he has a red spot under his shell close to his leg. I don't know what it is, but it doesn't look right. I feed him King British krill, clean his water regularly, haven't changed the filter sponge in a while but I do clean to sponge to get the muck out. The only difference I can possibly think that it might be the reason for this spot is I was advised by the pet store to buy some Calcium dusting powder (Komodo brand) and to sprinkle it on to some lettece and feed it to him every other day. He doesnt normally eat lettece or has calcium power, but I was told it will be good for him as I told her that I don't have a UV light? (but do take him out when its sunny) could the Calcium powder be the cause of this spot. Can anyone help in whats going on? whats the spot? how can I treat him?
