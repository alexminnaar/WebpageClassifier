Also, I highly recommend you follow me on Twitter or like me on Facebook page to get the latest offers and to avoid missing out on valuable and free gifts. I update the pages regularly. The promotion times are very popular in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. Things to keep in mind: If you are living in those countries and especially if you are in a big cities, I would recommend you pre-ordering the bonus. There are dates for each bonus period, BUT there is also a notice: “while supplies last” for each promo. That’s the reason why pre-ordering isn’t a wasting of time. As soon as I know about a new offer I will add it to my schedule list. How to pre-order and secure the bonus gift? You can reserve a gift like I do; you basically go in-store and say what you want. Ask about the bonus, they will inform you about the minimum amount so you know how much you need to spend in order to get the gift. Are the GWP offers available online only? It depends. Usually, the promotions are available online as well as in-store. When talking about Clinique bonus time promotion at a particular department store, I think the bonus is always available at the Clinique counter (in-store) and sometimes for online purchasing. The most popular department stores for Clinique bonus United States Canada United Kingdom and Ireland Dillard’s The Bay Boots Macy’s Sears Debenhams Nordstrom Brown Thomas Belk Fenwick Macy’s House of Fraser + many others like: Saks, Boscov’s, Cos Bar, Bloomingdales, Bon Ton, … Almost the same stores are participating on the other GWP offers provided by Estee Lauder and Lancome. 37 thoughts on “Clinique bonus + other GWP offers in 2017” Jane says: April 6, 2013 at 3:37 pm I haven’t receive any bonus or gift yet.

I would love to see if there are also GWP from Dior or Chanel, let us know if you hear anything! Reply Jess Morgan says: January 25, 2017 at 11:28 am Clinique has a wonderful Smart Rewards program for free (on Clinique.com), and you get free shipping for most of their eligible free GWP orders. Also, it’s a good idea to sign up for the loyalty programs on each of the other sites. Sometimes they give you free shipping. Nordstrom online offers free shipping for almost all their purchases anyway, so you can order even if you live in a different city.And if you live in the city where the free GWP is offered, it’s better to go instore and pick up the free gift early rather than wait or have it shipped. The supplies are usually gone within the first 5 days, even if the promotion is supposed to last 2 weeks. Reply Monica says: March 16, 2017 at 5:09 pm I only ever buy my products when there is a GWP. It has become so helpful because I never have to buy eye shadow, mascara, eye make up cleaner, lipstick/lip gloss, etc. I love it! The best part is that I use different products from different brands, so I have a large collection of great designer products that I received as bonuses. You can even maximize your gifts sometimes. I just spent about $100 on Estee Lauder at Macy’s. I needed several skin care products and foundation. They have 15% off beauty, a GFW and add-ons to the GWP when you spend more. AND a tote from Macy’s for spending $65 on beauty. I love it! Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
