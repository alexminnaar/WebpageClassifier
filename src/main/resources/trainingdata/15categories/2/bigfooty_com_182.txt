Clarkson is just an unbelievable coach and may very well become the greatest coach in AFL history. In round 11, they scored three behinds to Ports 9 goals at half time. They were insipid. In round 12 they lost to the Gold Coast. Hawthorn then had the bye, returned and defeated Adelaide...in Adelaide, belted the Pies when their coaches career and season was on the line, drew with the Giants and lost to Geelong by a couple of points. All this in a year where two of their best and oldest players were traded away and their list has had a shake up. Hawthorn may actually contend next year and it's unbelievable to say, when guys like Robbo (yeah I know Robby) were explaining it was the end of an era! Overall, what are your thoughts and from my perspective, kudos to Clarkson (if you're Collingwood you've gotta ******* throw everything at this man surely).   TheUndertaker, Jul 16, 2017 #1 Reply Gene Simmons, Turly, macdaddio and 24 others like this.

Sure Gibson isn't in the best 22 anymore but the other two are. Have to wait to see how Hawthorn go without Hodge and Burgoyne before deciding where they are in the rebuild process.   RUNVS, Jul 16, 2017 #9 Reply jackenny, The Sim Dog, sonnywalters and 2 others like this.

Hawks haven't even started rebuilding Besides I imagine Sydney and Geelong have had pretty quick rebuilds. Sydney especially have basically rebuilt and continued on without a pause   Duskfire, Jul 16, 2017 #11 Reply GotTheGoodes, bungee, The Sim Dog and 3 others like this. (Log in to remove this ad.) Jobe Watson Brownlow Medalist Essendon Other teams: Arsenal Joined: Jun 09 Posts: 11,705 Location: Melbourne Why is everyone so glowingly praising Hawthorn's little run of wins against a couple of the top teams? Their overall season has been terrible. They're in the bottom 6. Did many people predict them to fall that far in 2017? I know I for one had them playing finals; they've been worse than I expected. They've only just started their rebuild. 34-year-old Burgoyne is still their 2nd best player. They're in for a few years in the doldrums as they start trying to reform their list. Hitting this year's draft without a first round pick isn't a great start.   Last edited: Jul 16, 2017 Jobe Watson, Jul 16, 2017 #12 Reply bungee, Danger Zone, The Sim Dog and 22 others like this.

Dangerfield stole all of Mitchell's thunder yesterday just like Geelong killed the small chance Hawthorn thought they had at still accomplishing something this year.   Bounce, Jul 16, 2017 #13 Reply Whit3y, tigers_of_old_08 and HaroLad like this.

I cant see him going though. The turnaround has been incredible, not really a rebuild though. It would be an almost unique position to fall so far after such a long time on top. Hawks aren't a club I would generally think of as lacking desire to win, but there must be some challenges for the coach and the experienced players to get themselves up every year in the circumstances. Seems from what little I know is its coming from the younger guys, who want their time on top. I do think their youth has been seriously underestimated, I guess we all knew they have a great club system, led by Clarkson.   Bokonon_, Jul 16, 2017 #17 Reply Fetnarr, Teaser_ and Bounce like this.

How could their rebuild have been successful when so far it has consisted of signing a VFL player (Vickery) and a guy with a busted knee who never plays?   HaroLad, Jul 16, 2017 #18 Reply bungee, tigers_of_old_08 and Bounce like this.

If you wanna bring Richmond into it because you're a troll, let's talk about the 10 premierships we've won compared to your 9. 10 is more than 9 (I feel like I need to make that clear) and we've been shithouse since Thriller was released.

Just because the AFL doesn't appreciate them doesn't mean they're not there I'll give you a little preview of how unsuccessful your club truly is.
