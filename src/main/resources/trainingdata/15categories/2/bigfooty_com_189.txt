OP was more about his tenure at Adelaide and Melbourne and the turn around since he was marched from both. I've long been a Craig critic. I don't think the brand of bullshit that guys like him and Terry Wallace employ has worked for a long time in footy.   TerryWallet, May 17, 2014 #11 Reply Cudi_420 likes this.

Why not? He has been Director of coaching at both Clubs. IMO John Barker has had a negative effect on 3 successive Clubs, Hawthorn, St Kilda and Carlton. And he's only a line Coach. Craig has been Senior Coach and Director of Coaching at 3 successive Clubs that the players are not responding at. And the 2 that he left have immediately turned it around.   TerryWallet, May 17, 2014 #12 Reply Cyclonus All Australian Adelaide Other teams: Joined: Jun 11 Posts: 605 Location: Melbourne He had a pretty good coaching record at the Crows. Obviously 2010-11 were terrible due to players going on longer than they could have and the youth development being pretty poor, but before that they played finals most years under him. Perhaps similar to Ross Lyon at St. Kilda, he chased the premiership without a backup plan for the years to come, but unlike Ross and the Saints, never got to the Grand Final. 2005-06 were good years though. Actually, so was 2009. Can't say much for his tenure elsewhere.   Cyclonus, May 17, 2014 #13 Reply Buzzasto DaSilva likes this.

But i reckon his style of player handling demonstrably hasn't worked at his last 3 Clubs. I think we went thru an era say mid 90's to mid 00's where spin worked(in football. politics etc) , But i reckon that style then became anathema to motivating people. I just think the Terry Wallace's, the Neil Craig's are a bygone style. The directness style of a Hinkley, Lyon seems more respected. Neil Craig has got nothing out of a footballer for about 6 years over 3 Clubs.   TerryWallet, May 17, 2014 #15 Reply NickoST Team Captain West Coast Other teams: Joined: May 13 Posts: 329 Never trust a man with two first names.   NickoST, May 17, 2014 #16 Reply sverik25, Tbonefreo, riteo and 7 others like this.

Click to expand... My avatar goes alright... But yes, the OP is looking too deep into it. He seemed to bring out the best in players during his early Adelaide years, and it seemed like it was more Neeld than anyone that did the damage at the Dees.
