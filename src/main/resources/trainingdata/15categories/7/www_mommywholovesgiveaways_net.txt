I received a promotional item to thank me for my participation. Being a mom of two amazing little girls, I try my best to do everything possible to keep them happy and healthy. I’m a busy mom of two by myself all week because my husband (their dad) works out of state during the week. No matter how busy I am I always strive to keep my children as happy and healthy as possible. Keeping them healthy involves regular check ups of course keeping them up to date on all shots and an occasional blood test. Although my kids hate getting blood work or shots, it is what is best for their health. So the quicker the better. Thankfully there is a a new TB Blood Test that is so much easier, and more accurate than the skin test doctor’s have been giving patients for the last 110 years! The blood test can help diagnose tuberculosis (TB) infection and is a major scientific advance over the … [Continue] Filed Under | Health Sweetworks Fall Display & Giveaway #SweetworksAutumn October 1, 2015 by Shawna 70 Comments This is a Fashionista Event and a promotional item was provided to me by Sweetworks. Hosts for this event are Still Blonde after all these Years and ModlyChic. Fall has always been my favorite season. Being in the country in West Virginia when the leaves change is an amazing sight. Decorating for fall/autumn has never been easier with Sweetworks. Sweetworks makes creating beautiful fall/autumn displays so easy. I used the  Autumn Mix Sixlets to fill an autumn themed container, and mixed Autumn Mix Gumballs with the Autumn Mix Sixlets inside a small glass. I then add the  Foiled Semi-Solid Turkey chocolates to make a cute Sweetworks fall display that we love. I tried a simple version first and although I like them both my daughter likes the one above better. What do you think?  Who's ready for a Sweetworks Giveaway? One winner will receive a $50 selection of Fall Sweetworks candy including celebrations pearls, sixlets, Chocolates and gumballs.

I am being compensated for helping create awareness about Pinnacle's Newly Formulated Grain Free Dog, but Mommy Who Loves Giveaways only shares information we feel is relevant to our readers. Pinnacle is not responsible for the content of this article.  My husband and I have always shared a love for dogs. Myself, I love all animals but have always adored dogs. Growing up, I always had a dog and a cat. I have a soft spot for dogs and my neighborhood knows this. Unfortunately, I live out in the country where dogs are just dropped out in the middle of nowhere when they are unwanted. This is how I ended up with 8 dogs, all mixed breed but very well loved. Meet Wolfie, who is a mommies boy and has been since a puppy. Such a sweet heart and loves to be outside. Our dogs live outside most of the time which makes them very happy. However they do love to come on the porch and inside for some … [Continue] Filed Under | Pets Being our healthy best is essential on weekends September 25, 2015 by Shawna 1 Comment Disclosure: This is a sponsored post on behalf of Nature’s Bounty®. All opinions are 100% my own. While weekdays are hectic at our house the weekends are even worse. We are always on the go. My husband works out of state all week and is home on the weekends. While he is home we try our best to do as many family activities as possible. Being our healthy best is a little more difficult on the weekends for us.

I received a promotional item to thank me for my participation.” In order to help me achieve a good night’s sleep, I have been personally practicing healthy shut-eye strategies – including signing off from social media at least one hour before bedtime. I have found that simply plugging up my smartphone at least an hour before bed has helped me tremendously. I also take away the iPad from my 6 year old an hour before bedtime and she is feeling better as well. I get a better night's sleep and wake up feeling better than I have in years. I used to lay in bed with a million things running through my head. Now, I lay down and within minutes I am drifting off to sleep. I haven'the had this much energy in a long time. Being a mom of two girls who seem to have an endless supply of energy requires mom to do everything in her power to help keep up.
