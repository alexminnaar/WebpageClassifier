A little about Remote Central... As home theaters become more and more popular, sooner or later everyone begins to experience the same basic problem: too many remote controls sitting on the coffee table. While a few such as those packaged with television sets or receivers may feature basic universal capability, it always seems there's a few buttons on every other remote that you're unable to program yet just can't live without. That's where a universal remote control comes in. One unit that can learn the signals for even the most obscure feature and allow you to finally, once and for all, put the rest away. This site is designed to be the ultimate online source for information on mid- to high-end home theater remote controls with exhaustive reviews, complete specifications, programming guides and user-to-user forums for the latest and greatest products on the market.
