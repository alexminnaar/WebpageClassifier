End of story. It's an AK and will shoot any ammo you give it and it will work just fine. cornhskr When in doubt, empty the magazine Joined May 2009 Posts 5632 EE 100% (35) WA, USA Posted: 6/15/2017 10:35:21 PM EDT Quote History Originally Posted By swampvol: I really like Golden Tiger.

What is your concept of SHTF? Stack for later range use? Questions you may want to ask yourself. For long range storage and best performance, Yugo M67. For devastating performance against 2 legged critters, the Tula 8M3, along with the mentioned M67. The M67 is corrosive and a lot of folks shy away from that, but no real need in it. If your wolf is good to you and Wolf Poly HP is a favorite of my rifle, then it is cheap to stack and the sealed stuff is back in full force and affordable. GT was good in the past according to the fans, but it has fallen on suspect quality of late. It may be corrected, it may not. Some call a misfire or more in every 100 rounds acceptable, I don't.

If you are looking for long storage, the Wolf "Mil Spec" is sealed around the primer and neck. It should perform pretty much as the Poly, and give you some life options. Check it out and see if it works for you. Castrolr1 1N23456 Joined Feb 2008 Posts 2708 EE 0% (0) AZ, USA Posted: 7/6/2017 12:11:22 AM EDT silver or golden bear??

The stuff is loaded hot, sealed neck and primer, lacquered case so it won't rust. The bullet is fmj boat tail but the inside the tip of the bullet is hollow which helps with expand like the Yugo m67 ammo. Best of all its non corrosive and you can fit 1000 rounds in a 50cal ammo can. I prefer to make 120 round battle packs by vacuum sealing them with a food saver. If you do it right it makes a giant block of ammo. You can get it at at sg ammo. Same price or less as wolf with more better features. Google golden tiger 7.62x39 bullet. There is alot of cutaways showing the bullet insides. bluefalcon No bounce. No play. Joined Jan 2006 Posts 19341 EE 100% (19) AZ, USA Posted: 7/8/2017 1:13:34 PM EDT In terms of terminal effect only, notwithstanding accuracy and reliability, which are mainly determined by your own rifle: The very best available in 7.62x39mm is Federal Fusion. Also very good but slightly less expensive is S&B 123 gr soft point and Hornady SST (Zombiemax). Also very good but even less expensive are virtually any 120ish gr soft point. Tula 154 gr soft point did expand in one of my tests, but 154 gr is lower velocity so it is likely to fail to expand at a closer range than the 120ish gr projectiles and it has a more curved trajectory. With the exception of 8M3, none of the Russian hollow point ammo is likely to expand. M67, Golden Tiger, and a few other types of FMJ tend to yaw earlier and cut a wider path than other FMJ, but this distinction is fairly minor. FMJ, even the better stuff is nowhere even close to as effective as projectiles that expand and/or fragment reliably. If 7.62x39mm was my go-to SHTF rifle, I would buy enough Federal Fusion to fill my first line gear, zero, and have a couple boxes left over and I'd also buy a bunch of S&B 123gr soft point. I'd document the dope between the two cartridges and maybe also get a bunch of whatever cheap Russian 120ish gr soft point and document that dope also. Train with the cheap Russian stuff and stack the S&B deep as I can. ...our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor HeavyMetal Veteran of a Thousand Psychic Wars Joined Feb 2001 Posts 35950 EE 100% (4) WV, USA Posted: 7/8/2017 1:44:14 PM EDT Quote History Originally Posted By pavlovwolf: Tula 8M3.

Member here posted this vid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ENhmMKuaVUYep, 8M3While 8M3 is certainly badass, my opinion is that the wounding mechanism (fragmentation) isn't as dependable at longer range as expansion from soft points. I do think that it is more damaging at close range, but for a general purpose hunting, zombie space aliens, and rainy day defense load, soft points are more versatile and more barrier blind. ...our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor HeavyMetal Veteran of a Thousand Psychic Wars Joined Feb 2001 Posts 35951 EE 100% (4) WV, USA Posted: 7/8/2017 9:43:55 PM EDT Quote History Originally Posted By bluefalcon: While 8M3 is certainly badass, my opinion is that the wounding mechanism (fragmentation) isn't as dependable at longer range as expansion from soft points.

It's an actual hunting bullet compared to other commie bullets and expands as such. Plus it's pretty darn cheap.

And, while I haven't tested for barrier performance, soft points should generally do better. ...our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor bluefalcon No bounce. No play.

If the round is really good at expanding,its not much good if the accuracy sucks. I havent shot any of the new 8M3 to see if the accuracy is good or not but its something to keep in mind.
