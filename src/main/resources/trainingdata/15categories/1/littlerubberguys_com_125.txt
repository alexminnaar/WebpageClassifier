Trash Bag Bunch Series 2 repaints for Trade - US Shipping Started by deadfishlake , Yesterday, 04:23 AM Please log in to reply 1 reply to this topic #1 deadfishlake deadfishlake Gimme everything you got! Members 361 posts Gender:Male Location:Northern Illinois Posted Yesterday, 04:23 AM Hey all, it's been a LOOOOONG time since I've posted, but I'm putting my TBB series 2 repaints up for TRADE ONLY.  All are very good condition except wolfie, he's got paint loss and a chipped ear   I'm looking to trade for hard Bad Eggz Bunch, or TBB Series 2 new sculpts.  I'd trade 1:1 for Bad Eggz, or 2:1 for TBBS2 new sculpts.  Maybe 3:1, if it's a sculpt I really like.   My feedback here is good but pretty old, and I have excellent feedback elsewhere (ebay, Facebook groups, etc.). Shipping comes from northern Illinois. Let me know if you're interested, and thanks!
