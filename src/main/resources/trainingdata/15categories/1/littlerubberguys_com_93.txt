Also what is the deal with the shileds. Did they also come with shields? Thanks for the help. QL 0 Back to top #2 Spiritcrusher Spiritcrusher Serious Collector Members 151 posts Gender:Male Location:Virginia, USA Posted 27 July 2017 - 08:16 AM I paid $140 For my Brown Lion with his Laser gun. I paid $150 For a Grencats with his shield and Laser gun. Prices vary depending on condition and availability. My Laser Beasts are near mint condition. I don't think you will find them much cheaper, but you might get lucky if you search long enough. 0 Back to top #3 QuegLee QuegLee Budding Collector Members 13 posts Posted 27 July 2017 - 08:26 AM Wow, its definately a jump from what I'm used to paying. Thanks for the info. 0 Back to top #4 Spiritcrusher Spiritcrusher Serious Collector Members 151 posts Gender:Male Location:Virginia, USA Posted 27 July 2017 - 10:23 AM If you just want the figures without the weapon or shield, you can save some money and maybe find them in the $100 range. The prices have come down over the past year or so. The market has dropped a bit and there's not as many people actively buying Laser Beasts. Now is a good time to buy if you can find them 0 Back to top #5 QuegLee QuegLee Budding Collector Members 13 posts Posted 27 July 2017 - 10:43 AM Still, which beasts have shields? 0 Back to top #6 Spiritcrusher Spiritcrusher Serious Collector Members 151 posts Gender:Male Location:Virginia, USA Posted 27 July 2017 - 03:07 PM Let's see, as far as official shields, I believe all the mid level Laser Beasts had shields. There's the 6 in the Shield Battler set, Grencats, Battle Fennec, Fight Horn, Killer Hound, Strong Hurricane, and Mantrenzy. These shields are pretty easy to find and not too expensive for a collector. The most I paid for one of these shields was $50. Then the other 6 mid level Laser Beasts only came with European shields, which are very rare and expensive($200 range). Brown Lion, Hustle Bear, Dragon Seahorn, Sea Panic, Puzzle Color and Scope Cougar. Of course, there are also reproduction shields for every Laser Beast that were made in 2013. They are marked as Repro. You can find them on ebay for a decent price. 1 Back to top #7 QuegLee QuegLee Budding Collector Members 13 posts Posted 29 July 2017 - 09:58 AM Wow, i usually like to get the fig loose complete. Is there a significant diference between a repro shield and original one?

They look pretty much the same though. I have originals and repro shields. You can't really tell a difference unless you put them side by side 0 Back to top #9 QuegLee QuegLee Budding Collector Members 13 posts Posted 02 August 2017 - 07:08 AM Thanks for the info Spiritcrusher 0 Back to top #10 Spiritcrusher Spiritcrusher Serious Collector Members 151 posts Gender:Male Location:Virginia, USA Posted 02 August 2017 - 02:32 PM No problem man, glad to help 0 Back to top Back to What's it worth?
