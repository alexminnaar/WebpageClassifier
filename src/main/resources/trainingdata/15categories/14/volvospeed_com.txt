GoPro with the Hero3, and Contour with their top of the line Contour+2. Both systems have their merits and draw backs, so we are not going to turn this into a Coke or Pepsi / Nikon or Canon type debate. At first glance, you will notice a few things about the Contour camera. Most noticeably, it is metal and has a much lower center of gravity than the GoPro. Spec wise the cameras are pretty much on par with two exceptions. The GoPro Hero3 Black Edition will do a higher frame rate at 720p (120fps) and 1080p (60fps). This feature can be nice when trying to do a lot of slow motion effects, or if you are shooting extremely high-speed sports. On the other side of the table, the Contour+2 is GPS enabled. This allows you to embed telemetry and maps not only with the included software, but also with 3rd party software such as Trackvision.   Read More...
