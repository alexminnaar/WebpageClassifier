Alpha BRAIN: The Clinical Study I believe that a time is coming where taking nootropics like Alpha BRAIN will be a standard human adaptation to get things done. Like drinking coffee. Except in a lot of ways, I like Alpha BRAIN better than coffee. It has no stimulants and works by directly stimulating neurotransmitters. So it won’t wear out your adrenals. But if you like coffee, enjoy them both at the same time. Go ahead and be on fire. Laying down on the pillow after a long day of crushing it is one of the most satisfying feelings in life. – Aubrey Marcus, Onnit Founder Competition is unavoidable. No matter how altruistic your intentions, you are competing. If you are in the corporate structure, you are competing for a promotion. If you are in the stock market, you are competing against other investors. If you run a small business, you are competing against other companies. If you are dating, you are competing against other suitors. If you are a parent, you are competing to create more time to do what you love.     If you aren’t taking Alpha BRAIN, you are playing at a disadvantage.
