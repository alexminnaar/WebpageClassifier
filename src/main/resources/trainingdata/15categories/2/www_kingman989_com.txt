If one takes proper care of the fashionable shoes they can be worn for a long period of time. Footwear’s like evening shoes, fun shoes and sandals can be selected for an immediate use. When you go for buying shoes, you should try to select one that looks unique and trendy. There are some people who think that if they wear a long dress, their shoes will be unnoticed, so it does not matter if they wear an old one. This is not correct. Even though your feet will remain unnoticed but selecting proper evening footwear is very important.   Selecting fashionable footwear for an evening is enough to attract people towards you. The shoes made of low cut and open straps are considered slimmer than the footwear that has a closed toe. Popular Footwear made for a special evening is the one made of sling style or footwear that has an angled strap in it. Flat footwear or one with a low heel is perfect to wear with a trouser or suit. Women with a tall height can wear flats with ankle length skirts. You can have a unique look with elegant closed style footwear. The shoes made of patent leather, satin or silk look better than the one made of matte leather. Many people have a misconception that an evening shoe has to be made of black color. You can also select one made of silver or golden color as it will give a classic look. If you are tired of wearing the same old black colored evening footwear then try something different which will enhance the beauty of your outfit. Sandals are the next form of fashionable footwear. You can renovate your wardrobe by changing the footwear’s in it. If you love neutral colors, then you can select khaki, a beige sandal and at the same time should avoid white color. Wedges and the ballet flats are also great options when selecting footwear. If you have purchased a pair of ballet flats, make sure you wear them with miniskirts and slim trousers. Wedges make the calves appear slim and they also make the feet look smaller. The Roman sandals look great with summer linens, tunic dresses and tunics. When selecting footwear one should not only give importance to their looks but should also get the right size. If you are a woman, Byron Jonas recommends getting a good wardrobe of outfits because women’s fashion makes or mars your look. All women searching for women’s clothing online should try About A Girl. fashionableFootwearWomen Fashion Fashion Design School Accreditation September 14, 2015 admin Leave a comment Fashion Design School Accreditation Fashion design school accreditation is one of the most important aspects to consider as you’re choosing where you want to apply.

The days are getting longer, the air warming up, and within no time at all, we will all be bathing in the wonderful light of the summer sun. With summer comes all the usual activities: cocktail parties, trips to the beach, BBQs, picnics, strolls through the park. And, the usual problems: what to wear, how to tame hair affected by the humidity, how to prevent white marks on clothes, and how to stay cool. If you live in the UK, you will appreciate how difficult it is to know how the weather will be on any given day. Indeed, this April, we seemed to have a mini heat wave, and as you know, many of us have been left thinking, ‘was that our summer?’ – As has been the case in recent years. Hopefully, however, there will be many more sunny summer days to come yet, and now we turn our attention to the most important facet of summer: what styles are fashionable for 2011. Ok, so we cannot make any predictions about the weather, but one thing we know: there will be many fashionable items this season and the shopping malls will be full of wonderful designer clothing, from Great Plains Clothing to Prada, the fashionista amongst us are certainly spoiled for choice this season. There are several key trends this year, and the trends that you opt for should depend on your own personality and sense of style. With so many fashionable ranges from which to choose, even the most avoidant followers of fashion will find something suitable to wear. So then, let us turn our attention to some of the leading fashion trends for summer and spring in 2011: Summer is certainly the time for parties. In summer everybody wants to boogie on down at the local nightclub and shake of the dust of winter. Gone are the winter colours, the browns, the clacks and the greys, and in are the flamboyant summer colours: red, green, blue, yellow, pink, and gold (although avoid wearing all at once!). Designers, such as Great Plains Clothing (who are, incidentally, part of the French Connection family) have created a wonderful array of fashionable dresses for the party season. Expect to see many bold and beautiful creations in a variety of colours. For instance, their linen tunic dress in nautical ties in perfectly the nautical theme popular at the moment, and creates a wonderful cocktail dress, which is perfect for both formal and informal occasions alike. As well as the nautical theme for 2011, citrus shades are feature heavily in many fashion ranges this spring and summer, particularly pinks and oranges. Be careful when choosing colours, as too many different colours increase your chances of a clash. If in doubt, look to the catwalk for inspiration, if you see a common theme between designers, then this is a good sign that the colours go well together and that they will reach the high street in a few weeks time.
