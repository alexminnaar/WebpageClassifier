I am so happy to see the great hand of God in your work and in making this site .Your site itself is so beautiful. God does check his work after he finishes. Therefore I know, he will say that again about what he did through you here also. Gen 1:31 And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good…….. Just as Jesus said in John 15 that IF we abide in him and he in us we will bring much FRUIT and thus our father in heaven will be glorified. Many people do things for themselves and for own Glory. But it is good to see people living for HIM and doing EVERYTHING for him alone just as it is written 1Co 10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. Indeed it is also giving me great joy because you are doing it freely .God will make it an example for many to follow. As he COMMANDED to give freely he will make sure that we are taken care because he is faithful. We need just to obey as “fools for Christ” counting everything else as dong and dust just as apostle Paul said. Only to such he will give the greater and true treasure. Mat 13:44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Mat 13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like….. Luk 16:11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? Luk 16:12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own? Luk 16:13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

The Gospels are a good place to start, that is Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Which book or chapter to start many would say John, however go to where your lead to read. God’s Word does not come back void. » Reply to this Comment « bongs says: February 22, 2014 at 9:19 pm thank you very much.
