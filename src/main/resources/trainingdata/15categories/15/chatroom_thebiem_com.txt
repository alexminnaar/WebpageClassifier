HOME WELCOME! ^_^ !!IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!!   You can create a thread topic right here in the chatroom. Let me explain how it's gonna work. > You're gonna post the thread as a comment. > You can make it big, but for your and other ppls convenience, you should try to keep it as concise and to-the-point as possible. > You can even do this with a meaningful meme or picture. > Ask questions if you want. > Put #thread at the beginning of the comment.  > upon doing so, a present mod will feature your comment and keep it there for 60-90 mins. and it'll become the current topic for the chatroom. > Ofc, any form of shitpost will be fully allowed. > but those needing a topic and those wanting to ask something specific, can enjoy this. > Also, you're gonna get fc'ed for it. so the upvotes are gonna be your rewards.   Types of topics you should be aiming for:- -User Related -Some unique game shit - Funny shitpost shit  - Myaumyau crazy  - funny shit - Mainstream shit like dreams or regrets. - Rekts - Wananbe savage roasts - Clouds tits - Exposing type of shit - News and politics.   This is gonna be put into work from this moment onward. Mods, un-feature the current feature at the time when a thread comment is posted. If a 2nd one is posted while one is ongoing, link it in the server so that we can feature it later. That is all. Hope ya'll will find the system helpful.  Any feedback is appreciated! Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Visits 7,593 peepz Phat Beatz Copyright © 2017 Your Name.
