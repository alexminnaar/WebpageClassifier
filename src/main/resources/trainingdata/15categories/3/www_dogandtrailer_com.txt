We both felt that there was nothing better than the camaraderie and memories created by hanging out around the campfire at your favorite camp site with friends, family, and neighbors the next site over that you just met. Stories from the road, travelling from site to site, and being in the great outdoors either in a camper or tent is our common ground and we hope that Dog and Trailer brings everyone together to share their experiences and knowledge.  So come on in, pull up a stump, and enjoy your stay.
