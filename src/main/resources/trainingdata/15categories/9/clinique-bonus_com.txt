Current & upcoming free offers - Clinique Bonus Time August 2017 Clinique Bonus Time Home Dillard’s Macy’s Nordstrom Belk Other U.S. stores Canada United Kingdom and Ireland Current Bonus Offers by Clinique in 2017 Clinique bonus time is a period of time when a customer can get special gifts with Clinique product purchases. These promotions (happening regularly across the U.S., Canada, UK/IE and Australia) are created by Clinique with participating department stores such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, Dillard’s, Sears CA, Debenhams UK and more. Advertisements Ongoing promotions: There are 4 bonus times at this moment – at Belk and Bon-Ton stores in the United States and at John Lewis and Arnotts in the United Kingdom & Ireland. (last update: August 20th, 2017). When is the next Clinique bonus time? The next one will be at Bloomingdale’s or Dillard’s. Scroll down for the complete schedule. Advertisements How to get a gift In order to receive a gift (“Clinique Bonus”) you have to make a qualifying purchase. Purchasing Clinique products over a certain amount (usually in the USA, CA) or purchase a certain number of Clinique products (usually in the UK/IE only) during a promo period (“bonus time”) is the qualifying purchase. The qualifying purchase may vary store by store, but the limit is always less than the value of the bonus gift. The gifts usually include a cosmetic bag with favourite cosmetic products, as well as some new stuff to try that are in a sample size.

Use code: DAD I update this schedule regularly, as soon as I have information about upcoming offers. If you know something about upcoming bonus time which is not listed in the table above, please let me know on this facebook fan page or by email. I will add it, so everybody can prepare for it and get some free stuff, including brand new products. This makes the promotion very attractive for many ladies out there, they are able to try new things without spending money on them. Risk-free solution. If you haven’t heard about this kind of promotions before, it is called GWP (Gift With Purchase) offers. That means that you have to make a purchase. Only in that case you are eligible for a bonus. The purchase must be over certain amount of money.  Sometimes, the rule is to have at least 2 Clinique products in your bag, then no minimum purchase is required ($). You can use this bonus period to get your favourite products or new products via internet shopping or in-store shopping. I recommend you pre-order if the offer is at one of the most popular stores (Macys, Nordstrom). The bonus gift sets are on a first come first served basis, meaning they rarely last very long, so will be gone before the official expiration date of the promotion. Unfortunately, pre-ordering is not always available. 109 Comments Mary April 20, 2017 at 5:06 pm (4 months ago) I have been an extremely active customer of clinique for DECADES. Unfortunately, the stinginess of products and limited color palettes that seem to be recycled through the different stores, make bonus days more of an insult in comparison to the amount of money that I spend annually, throughout decades with Clinique. I no longer look forward to bonus days because its such an insult to see the hurdles and pettiness necessary to receive something that is a sample that clinique wants me to start buying. I still buy ONE product from Clinique that I love. Today out of curiosity I thought I’d see what was offered for Bonus days. Its all product that is not a bonus, but rather, another insult that Clinique has become so stingy and cheap that I am happy to know that my observations are correct and Clinique no longer holds itself to the standards that I deem worthy of the extra effort in acquiring. There are so many big retail makeup stores now that are generous and provide a high level of customer service, Ulta and Sephora, as well as outlet mall high end makeup stores. Why does Clinique think I want to jump through hopes to receive a cheezy little stick of mascara? You have become the maybelline of dept stores. Reply Annemarie harnett March 31, 2017 at 7:18 pm (5 months ago) I have just purchased items at the Clinique counter at Macy’s Florida mall, as I spent $40.44 I was given the free bonus promotion gift, however when I got back to my villa I was missing the chubby black mascara. I am in the states on holiday and going back tomorrow so unable due to timetable to get back to the store.is it possible for this to be sent yo main the uk? Reply Dana March 17, 2017 at 1:18 am (5 months ago) Hi, Today is March 16, 2017, and according to this website, Dillard’s should be having Clinique bonus time from March 3-22, 2017. However, I just talked to employees at two different Dillard’s Clinique counters in my town (Austin, TX), and they told me the bonus time ended two days ago. I just wanted to let you know so that you could inform other people that it already ended at Dillards (unless it’s just the Dillard’s stores in my area?). I’m hoping to make it to the upcoming one at Macy’s. Thanks, Dana Reply Jeannie March 14, 2017 at 4:21 pm (5 months ago) I went to Dillards in Colorado on March 13th and the Gift with Purchase offer ENDED on March 12th. This website states the GWP ends on March 22nd. This website is incorrect. The woman at the Clinique counter apologized and said that many were disappointed that day that the website was incorrect. Bummer for us. Reply Alice March 14, 2017 at 4:42 pm (5 months ago) Just checked the Dillards official website and the offer is still live. Maybe it has been sold out at some Clinique counters? Reply Jeannie March 14, 2017 at 6:55 pm (5 months ago) No, it was not active at the Flatirons Dillards store. Are there different dates for on-line vs in-store? Reply Darlene Youngquist January 24, 2017 at 4:47 pm (7 months ago) I ordered clinique products on Jan.17,2017. Order #1146811025. On line it states that there is a bonus gift included after spending $27.00. I did not receive this gift with my order. I called today and the girl on the pone did not see that there is a bonus gift included. Why did I not get the bonus after it shows on this page that I ordered on the right date to get it with my order. I will never order from L & T again!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Reply Sally November 8, 2016 at 12:57 am (10 months ago) There is an unadvertised (I think) bonus coming up at the Bon Ton near me, in Hamden, CT. I don’t know whether it is available at all stores. It begins this Wednesday, 11/9, and only runs for a few days. It’s a nice gift! I only learned about it because I happened to walk in there today. Reply lois September 26, 2016 at 12:37 am (11 months ago) I will be purchasing eye cream on Sept 28th at a local Macy’s store. Can you tell me what will be in the gift bag since i do have some products at home but would like to try new items. If i knew what was being offered in the gift bag i could decide whether to purchase my eye cream at Macy’s or on line where i do have choices. Thank you. Reply Lily September 10, 2016 at 2:47 pm (11 months ago) They are offering the same GWP that was at Stage stores in July at Century 21 department stores right now. 🙂 Reply Lily August 11, 2016 at 10:44 pm (1 year ago) Hello do you know any information about GWP’s at Century 21 stores? I was just walking by one and saw they were offering a Lamcone GWP right now so wondering about Clinique as well. (By the way I didn’t see any information online about that particular Lancome GWP, it’s pretty cute!) Reply Lily August 20, 2016 at 11:39 pm (12 months ago) Oh sorry my bad, it was actually an Estée Lauder GWP. Same one as was at Lord n Taylor with the little animal key chains. The lady at the Clinique counter told me they going to be offering a GWP next month. So we will see if it mimics any other stores :)!

Did not get all bonus items. Did not get the Beyond Perfecting Foundation & Concealer. I live in Indiana & cannot get back to the Kenwood store any time soon. Any suggestions? Thank you Reply Cheryl Garrett February 11, 2016 at 6:00 am (2 years ago) I shopped at McDonough, Ga. Belk today because I needed some makeup. I purchased your Superpowder double face powder superpowder. It is bonus time and my bill was $25.68 including taxes and I could not get your bonus gift because I did not spend $27.00! Why do you set your limit so high to get the bonus gift? $2.00 kept me from getting the bonus. I NEVER get the bonus gift because I can’t afford to purchase another item. I could have purchased a $4 pencil sharpener or extra sponge, which can be bought anywhere much cheaper. Your products are very expensive and you would think you would offer a free bonus gift with any purchase. Or at least lower the limit to match your products. Keeping your limit so high does not get people to spend more money to get the free gift. Reply lINDA October 14, 2015 at 9:51 pm (2 years ago) Why are the pictures of the bonus gifts no longer showing? Reply Alice October 14, 2015 at 10:07 pm (2 years ago) which pictures do you mean? everything works for me. Send me an email where exactly you cant see the pictures, I will try to fix it. Reply Diane Biet September 24, 2015 at 4:21 pm (2 years ago) I am a fan of Clinique products and have been so for over 20 years. That is the reason why I stopped at the Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport Duty Free in Brazil yesterday and among other Clinique products I bought a Clinique Ever Better to take advantage of a promotion they were advertising. Much to my disappointment, after paying USD 189 for my Clinique products I was told that they did not have any Clinique bonus products because they were substituted for an empty plastic bag, which I rejected. I currently live in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I thought that you might be interested to know how your brand is being used and spoiled by some vendors. Thank you, Diane Biet Reply Carol September 4, 2015 at 4:08 am (2 years ago) is there any chance that CLINIQUE will offer a set of brushes or gift with purchase Reply krissy August 27, 2014 at 11:17 am (3 years ago) Clinique offered “Happy” nail polish in the Belk gift for August, 2014. I was excited for my daughter starting High School Band (their color is Red) and myself so we can enjoy it especially for this occasion. They were sold out of that gift in the Belk store and only had the Happy-heart Bright Pink color. The Belk website did say that they had both gifts so I placed my order and chose the “Happy” gift at the end…It was turned down! So, I called the phone number and they told me the Belk website was out of the gift. There was also a blush and lipstick that look great on my daughter but I was upset that the website said they had it and DID NOT! Clinique is a big company-why can I not have a sample of red polish with my purchase? Frustrated Mother… Reply Kathy June 7, 2014 at 5:52 pm (3 years ago) Are the products in the gifts w purchase gluten free? It would be so helpful for women with celiac to have a list of gluten free Clinique products. When I ask at the store’s Cosmetic counter I always get an ‘I don’t know’ reply. Reply Marni July 15, 2014 at 6:36 pm (3 years ago) Kathy, first of all I would suggest that if you’re interested in cosmetic ingredients you read the labels and do some research. Sales associates are typically only educated in the use of their products, not pharmacology. Second of all, I sincerely hope you have not been eating your Clinique products. Ingesting food with glutinous proteins is the only way someone with Celiac’s Disease would have any kind of reaction… so knowing whether or not gluten-containing grains have been used in topical make-up seems moot Reply Anna July 25, 2014 at 8:51 am (3 years ago) Thank you, Marni, for your common sense reply. I think this gluten-free thing’s gotten a bit out of hand. Not for those with actual Celiac’s, but there are far too many hypochondriacs out there loving the trend. Reply TRACY January 28, 2014 at 9:44 pm (4 years ago) I’m confused. In your “how to pre-order by phone” instructions for Belk, Kayla says “$9 shipping for orders under $50, and free shipping for orders over $50”, but Belk’s website says “free shipping-no minimum purchase-for all beauty, all of the time”. Which is correct? Reply spas February 14, 2014 at 10:19 pm (4 years ago) Hi Tracy, I ordered Clinique from Belk a week ago to get that GWP and paid 0 for shipping. There is never shipping fees from Belk for beauty products. Their website is correct. BLOOMINGDALES, however, has a $50 minimum for free shipping, and their GWP is still active. Reply Patty March 19, 2014 at 7:28 pm (3 years ago) If you order from the actual store there is usually a shipping rate for purchases under $50 because we ship live products from our store. But online is different =) Reply Janet January 4, 2014 at 7:21 am (4 years ago) Wow! Thank you for the work you do, that makes my shopping with you fun and easy. Hurrah! Reply Lisa November 20, 2013 at 11:16 pm (4 years ago) Thank you for this website! I love it! I have it bookmarked and will be visiting it often to see what current offers are out there!! Do you have any information on 2014 bonus times yet? I can’t believe there is just a little more than a month left until then.. Thanks again! Reply Zoey November 12, 2013 at 9:11 am (4 years ago) I believe macy’s is currently having a giveaway for $60+ purchases for a tote bag and a set of makeup and samples you could get with the tote. love the 3 colored tote so prettyy!

Reply J L July 2, 2013 at 11:43 pm (4 years ago) In June, Bloomingdale’s website did not show the 7-piece gift set. Instead it offered a bonus gift of the All About Eye Rich 0.5 oz with $50 of purchase. It specifically stated that the bonus gift was an actual product that sells for $30. I often bought that eye cream and thought that was a great bonus gift. However, what I actually received was a tiny 0.17 oz jar. I called Bloomingdales but they denied the bonus gift was supposed to be 0.5 oz. Unfortunately I did not take a screen shot of the website at the time and the size was not stated on my order. That was false advertisement and I will not order from Bloomingdales any more. I wonder if others had the same experience.

Reply Christine January 2, 2013 at 6:07 am (5 years ago) Hey Alice, what is the best combo to revive my post chemotherapy skin. It is blotchy grey and I have no color at all. My eyes look like they have sunk back in my head and the dark circles are just plain scary. I know I need to change what I was doing, but have no idea where to start. I just want to look alive again. Thanks. Reply Briana Ellsworth January 2, 2013 at 1:09 am (5 years ago) Stumbled upon your site today and I’m very excited! Quick question: Do you announce winners on this blog, or will they receive a notification via email/twitter/etc.? xx Bri Reply Alice January 2, 2013 at 12:38 pm (5 years ago) Thank you so much Briana. I appreciate it:) quick answer: yes, both. Winner will be announced here and I also send an email. Maybe I also mention it on my FB page. but only if she will be willing to.
