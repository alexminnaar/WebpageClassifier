From the moment you walk into any of the rooms all your senses are awakened to the new experience. Your eyes adjust to the dim light in the Cave Suites, your nose catches a whiff of the wood from the Western Suite or the rubber from the Speedway Suite. The artwork on the walls and attention to detail integrating the common hotel commodities into the theme will amaze you. Come in and see for yourself.
