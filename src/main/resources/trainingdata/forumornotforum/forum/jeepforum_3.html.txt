Was at the dealer today getting screwed for the cost of a new evap coil. And while I was there I asked the service gent about my up coming 2nd 5yr inspection (my Jeep will be 10 this October) He said they are not sending out cards to remind anybody to get the inspection, so if you forget, you are screwed. You have a 30 day window to have the inspection done. I bought mine October 5th of 07. So I have from Sept 5th to Oct 5th to get it inspected. One day late, you are screwed. You also can not bring it in any sooner, it has to be in that 30 day window. Since FCA is not notifying people like they did on you first 5 yr inspection, I think they are in for law suits if people miss there second?? Even the service guy looked at me like, yeah there are going to try and screw people cause they dont want to pay for this lifetime warranty anymore.

Thanks for the reminder. However... Where did you get the 30 day window information? This is from the Lifetime Warranty publication: "G. Inspections In order to maintain the Lifetime Powertrain Limited Warranty, the person or entity covered by this Powertrain Limited Warranty must have a powertrain inspection performed by an authorized Chrysler, Dodge, or Jeep dealer once every 5 years. This inspection will be performed at no charge. The inspection must be made within sixty (60) days of each 5 year anniversary of the in-service date of the vehicle. You must have the inspection performed to continue this coverage." According to the dealers I have talked with, that means there is a 120 day window. Just to make sure, I would have it done within 60 days prior to each 5 year anniversary of the in-service date of the vehicle. 2008 JKU Rubicon 42RLE Auto ronjenx is offline   Quote Quick Reply ronjenx View Public Profile Find More Posts by ronjenx post #3 of 12 Old 07-14-2017, 10:53 AM propped1 Registered User 2007 JK Wrangler   My Specs Engine: 3.8L Transmission: auto Transfer Case: 2.7 Front Axle: D30 Rear Axle: D44 Axle Gear Ratio: 4.10 Suspension: RK 2.5" w/Bilstein: 5160 front/5100 rear/steering stabilizer.

As long as you can prove the work was done the warranty is in force. Jeeps: Where my 401(k) went to die!

FCA can't change the rules. When Fiat bought controlling interests in the company they bought the assets AND the liabilities. Essentially the courts will say "tough, you bought it, you own it." If you follow the rules as laid out in the owners manual you can relax. Jeeps: Where my 401(k) went to die!

FCA can't deny warranty if you don't use a franchised dealer for service. As long as you can prove the work was done the warranty is in force. Not true. Warranty claims are submitted and either approved or denied. Your insurance kinda works the same way. FCA is being more strict in approving warranty claims. You could sue them for the practice... But the filing fee is $400 plus lawyer. You wouldnt want a ****ty lawyer either. One of those $300+ hour types. Just prepping to file and writing it up, would be in the 3000 range. Then you might lose. Need to appeal. Where do you stop? They got way more money than you, and their lawyers are on the payroll. Youd also need to prove that everything in the warranty agreement you followed to the letter. Maintenance intervals with receipts. What is right, wrong, practical, and etc. doesnt matter.... it just is. They know that. Unfortunately it falls on the dealer. The dealer gets the bad press/word of mouth. Our clubs around here have reps from all the major dealers. Constantly hearing good and bad stories. Sometimes a dealer will clean up another dealers mess. Is FCA approving with them and not with the other, or is it an opportunity to look good infront of a large group of potential customers so they are covering? I dont know, but either way, I dont trust dealerships or auto manufacturers. Buy used, get a good mechanic. ._______ /_l__[___], l--|--|--L-OlllllllO] (o)_) (o)_)o-)_) propped1 is online now   Quote Quick Reply propped1 View Public Profile Find More Posts by propped1 post #11 of 12 Unread 07-17-2017, 07:01 PM SoK66 Registered User 2009 JK Wrangler   My Specs Engine: 3.8L Transmission: 42RLE Transfer Case: 241 Front Axle: Teraflex R44 Rear Axle: Stock Rubi D44, G2 chromoly axle shafts Axle Gear Ratio: 5.38 Suspension: Teraflex 4" long arm, Fox/Teraflex resis, Teraflex SpeedBumps Tires: 37" MT ATZ P3 37" Wheels: Trailready HD beadlocks 17" Recovery: Warn Powerplant winch Armor: Teraflex bumpers, Nemesis flares & skids, Synergy skid plates, Rock Hard cage Accessories: Too many to list Future Mods: RCV front shafts User Profile   Join Date: Jul 2011 Location: Durango Posts: 1,492  Profile  Gallery  Classifieds  My Jeeps I spent thirty years on the manufacturer side of automotive service. The terms of the warranty ARE NOT set by dealers, The terms are set by the manufacturer's warranty language at the time of sale, PERIOD. The Magnuson-Moss Warrsnty Act established the law nearly 40 years ago, case closed. No lawyers needed, small claims action is easy and effective. The courts will find for the buyer and may assess treble damages if the dealer and/or manufacturer try to screw the customer out of what they're entitled to. Relax, do what's called for in the owners manual and you're covered. Moparrules likes this.

Any reputable dealer is happy to do the warranty work. They get paid for it directly from the manufacturer. Sure, they have to document and get approval prior, but it's business (money) for them, with guaranteed payment.
