New flooring, window treatments and beds, luxurious linens, along with well-designed interiors make this motel/hotel a great deal. The pool was a bonus, with warm mineral water and lots of deck chairs for sunning. Coffee and pastries were offered in the foyer each morning. The best part was the wonderful staff.
