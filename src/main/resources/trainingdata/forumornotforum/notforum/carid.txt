You can get rid of that nose down attitude with a leveling kit, which may include strut extensions, coil spring spacers, or torsion keys to lift the front and make it level with the rear. A body lift will raise the body on the frame and is perfect if you want to install larger wheels and tires but don’t plan on driving off-road. For a rig that’s off road ready, we offer suspension lift kits up to 6” or more that will let you conquer the toughest terrain. Choose from basic kits to the most comprehensive, as well as individual components. Car makers have to be conservative with ride height, even on sports models, to satisfy bumper height and other regulations. You are under no such constraints, so to get that aggressive stance, lose the ugly gap between the fenders and tires, and improve your ride’s handling, we offer lowering kits. These kits contain progressive springs that will lower the ride height, but still provide a comfortable, albeit firm ride. Comprehensive kits contain firmer shocks or struts, or coilovers, and larger sway bars as well. Besides improving looks and handling, lowering your car can also reduce drag and increase fuel economy. Carrying heavy loads in a truck bed or towing a trailer can be a challenge if the vehicle isn’t set up properly, and once loaded you could end up with the headlights pointing at the sky and the rear bumper almost dragging the ground. We offer heavy-duty leaf springs, helper springs, and air springs, all designed to keep your vehicle level and stable, with a comfortable ride, when heavy loads are added. We also offer sophisticated self-leveling suspension systems that automatically inflate/deflate rear air springs or springs at all 4 corners to maintain vehicle ride height. Setting up a high-performance machine, especially for the race track, involves more than just shocks, springs, or struts. Reducing chassis flex will improve handling, especially on unibody vehicles with strut towers, and you can tie those towers together for strength and rigidity with our strut braces. Changing suspension height and running other than stock wheels and tires often requires additional parts like caster/camber plates, eccentric bolts, and alignment kits, to get the wheels properly aligned for optimum handling and even tire wear. Performance driving puts a strain on all suspension components, so you need parts that will stand up to abuse and come back for more. We can supply you with control arms, ball joints, and torsion bars designed to go the distance. We also offer an extensive selection of polyurethane bushings for every part of your suspension as well as body mounts. Polyurethane bushings are much more rigid than their rubber factory counterparts, for sharper handling and more precise steering. And to make sure vulnerable mechanical components survive off-road adventures, check out our assortment of skid plates.

Pro Comp® K5085B - 7" Stage 1 Front and Rear Complete Lift Kit It's a great look so I can't complain, but I just got the bare minimum package. Should've got the feature to add the additional shocks and would have been a little bit higher, or at least that's what the guy who installed it for me said.. So far I've gotten compliments on my 14 tundra. I fit 35s 20x12 wheels, and with cutting I'm still rubbing on the frame just a little bit. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.
