Gordon-Levitt and McCauley are very private about their lives. Back in 2015, Gordon-Levitt told Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan on an episode of “Live! With Kelly and Michael” that he really wanted to “protect his son’s privacy.” “My son, he’s just a baby. He hasn’t made the choice to be in the public eye, and that’s a choice I’d like him to be able to make when he’s older,” Gordon-Levitt said to Ripa and Strahan, “For now, I’m just a protective dad, and I want to protect his privacy.” At this time, no other information about the child, including his name, is known.
