It put a lot of people off, not because it was further to drive or that it didn't have the same facilities but because it wasn't actually the Billing show. I kinda understood where these people were coming from, the best show on the Vauxhall calender had been replaced. I went into it looking at it like a new show and I will let you guys into a secret. Billing wasn't about the location - it was about the people! The people who organised this ...

I have to say the lack of mad drivers was a bit of a let down... but thats just me. However the drifting session at 12 did have a Mk2 escort kiss another drift car, but it was minor and as normal with the drifters it barely slowed them down. The car variety was a bit more wide than previous years, I have no idea what this new iridescent lens coating is but there was a lot of it about The show stands were superb for someone like me, plenty of tools to dribble over, an obligitary ...

Read More 1 Comment Daily Mail Astra Article - Cars Needed  by Astra Dan Published on 17-02-2016 20:06 Again from Ian: "My apologies for sending out a specific model request to all but its quicker for me to do it this way. Vauxhall are looking for Astra pictures to accompany an article in the Daily Mail. Tom Careless of Vauxhall PR explains the problem they have and how you or your members could help (and get in the Mail!). "Most of the pictures we have internally are staged promotional shots, while the Mail journalist thinks that in order for it to work he would like more images of everyday people  he made particular reference to less staged photos of the car. He wants to show how ... Read More Castle Combe summer action day 2015  by Johnny A Published on 05-10-2015 20:04 Ahh last show of the year at my favourite circuit and the first time my better half was able to join us to enjoy the awesome cars, epic fun but very unstable drifters and the normal racers who were running out of skill every 15 minutes or so! Thanks to our man Tintin we had an excellent parking spot near the competitors entrance in the main paddock, perfect location for accessing every aspect including the coffee stands which is ultimately the most important thing for the missus! Even though the weather held out and was mostly dry there ... Read More 2 Comments Trax 2015  by Johnny A Published on 05-10-2015 18:51 Jap cars... like a LOT of jap hardware and plenty of air ride too which seems to be the weapon of choice for mega belly scraping low. Trax is always one of those shows that brings out the car modifiers with huge wallets or huge debt, the sheer amount of money and shiny things is awesome. Trax has a nice variety of modified cars surrounded by an awesome racing circuit with a style to suit almost every taste... yes that does include scantily clad young models who put their make up on with a trowel! ... Read More Wetro rides 2015 - To be reminded we live in the UK  by Johnny A Published on 22-09-2015 21:23 Hey guys sorry about the delay in getting the report out, life got in the way. That being said every year the Retro Rides Gathering is one of the most unique and exciting events about so it's hard to forget (as long as you love old retro cars that is!). After a pothole dodging drive to the location at Shelsley Walsh Hillclimb you get instantly subjected to awesome old cars intermixed with weird and wonderful hardware you have never seen before and will probably never see again. The MIG stand was perfectly located near the main entrance which ... Read More 3 Comments VBOA Billing 2015 show report  by Johnny A Published on 16-07-2015 19:51 The annual VBOA rally! I don't know about you guys but this is one of the highlights of my car related calender, minimal chav, maximum variety and disgusting Hawaiian shirts; what else can one ask for? Ok ok MAYBE a car with a decent paint job in my case but that didn't stop me showing it and actually winning something that wasn't a special needs trophy! We kick started off on Friday with awesome weather and an eagerness to actually do some work, my job as some of you know is to organise the car layout on the stand and I wasn't sure if it was the map I posted up or my dashing ... Read More 1 Comment PVS2015 - The Sun and the Sea (of blue Astras)  by Johnny A Published on 15-06-2015 19:42 You know how sometimes you have a bad feeling about a show? After reading the new rules set down by the new Performance/Total Vauxhall magazine owners I expected pandemonium, screaming, manic traffic, angry VXR owners, some guy running around in the background waving his arms in the air and cats and dogs living together..... but in reality aside from a bit of a rush to get in before the deadline everything worked out really well! The Sun was cooking everyone, we had plenty of new Vauxhall metal to gander over plus our old favourites, I had a disgusting Hawaiian shirt on (trust me, plenty ...

Read More 5 Comments Castle Combe summer action day - Ending on a high  by Johnny A Published on 18-09-2014 22:35 Well... it's the end of summer, the weather is getting dodgy and it's the last show on the MIG calendar - It's bound to go tits up right!?? Wrongo! We had a packed MIG show stand, all sorts of crazy powered metal, some epic (and often scary) racing, sunshine! and great friends. It was an early start for everyone and I arrived sporting a cool outfit, rusty Carlton and a mild coma. The action pretty much started as soon as I arrived, luckily for us all our cars arrived early so Tintin and I could bugger off to watch the track action. ... Read More Trax 2014 report  by Johnny A Published on 08-09-2014 19:43 Several weeks ago I think it's safe to say everyone in the UK had accepted that Summer was over and the last few shows were going to be cold, wet and miserable; and yet MIG seemed to pick the best year to return to Trax with a hot summer's day! Racing, drifting, lots of big power cars and some weird and wacky stuff too! The racing saw a few mishaps, a few drifters ended up in the sand trap and randomly one loosing a wheel! That's what happens when you let the apprentice at quik fit do your wheel nuts up with a 6-foot long breaker ...
