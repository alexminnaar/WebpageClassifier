Touch ID apps allow you to lock apps on your iPad or iPhone in order to protect sensitive information such as private documents or personal finance information, instead of setting a password you might forget. However, other apps such as Facebook don’t allow you to use Touch ID to lock the app. Whether or not an app uses Touch ID depends on the developer and how they intend you use the app. Once you have Touch ID enabled on your iPhone, you can use your fingerprint to open the Touch ID apps of your choosing. We’ll go over how to set up Touch ID apps below. We’ll also cover which popular apps are Touch ID apps and which ones offer fingerprint lock. And since setting up fingerprint lock on your iPhone often requires a passcode, we'll also cover how to put a password on apps.

The PowerJoy should ship soon and is a smart solution to a real problem. As Apple and other vendors transition to USB-C, most users still have a wide variety of devices that charge using a traditional USB cable. Instead of traveling with and using multiple charging bricks, the PowerJoy is one device with two charging ports, one for USB-C and one for traditional USB.
