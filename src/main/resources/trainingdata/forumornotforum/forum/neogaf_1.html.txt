The PS4 and digital Switch versions are $30, while the physical Switch edition costs $40 but comes with keychains (in America). If you live in PAL land, the pricing is kind of inconsistent. Click on each of the thumbnails for a video! Adventure A story? In… Tetris? Go on an adventure spanning 10 chapters with fully voiced cutscenes while clearing all sorts of gameplay challenges! Lesson Learn how to play with gameplay demonstrations! Solo Arcade and Multiplayer Arcade Play with up to four players & CPU and make enemies out of friends!

Online Challenge yourself in ranked battles against other players worldwide in Puzzle League, enjoy casual matches with up to 4 players in Free Play, and watch and upload replays! “I thought I was good at Tetris, but not anymore…” “What even is Puyo?! Is this some Mean Bean Machine shit” If this sounds like you, even despite absorbing the tutorials in Lesson mode, here’s some other guides and resources to get you started. Puyo Puyo Developing a “chain sense” (video) How to play Puyo Puyo Advanced Tutorials (video) Tetris Hard Drop Wiki - Finesse - T-Spins Advanced Tutorials (video) Yes, you can still play classic endless Tetris and one-on-one Tetris. That’s not even a question, but you should totally check out Puyo and all the other game modes as well! Is there colorblind support for Puyo? The “metallic” skin uses a more colorblind friendly palette, and the “alphabet” skin transforms all the puyos into letters. Is there cross-play between PS4 and Switch? What about region free online? No cross-play across different platforms, but you can play against the entire world without issue. Are there any differences between the characters? They have different items and dropsets in Party and Fusion mode, and their CPU AI behaves differently. Is there Japanese dual-audio? English dub only. I heard you couldn’t stream or upload videos of the game… That only applies to Adventure mode content in the Japanese version; the English version has no restrictions. If you want to be nice though, put the following on your videos somewhere: ©SEGA Tetris ®＆© 1985～2017 Tetris Holding. Why isn’t there a digital PS4 version? Blame The Tetris Company and their weird licensing rules.

Could not STAND the voices in the demo on Switch, and I'm really not excited to pay $40 for a Physical copy. bigkrev View Public Profile Send a private message to bigkrev Find More Posts by bigkrev Theswweet Member (04-24-2017, 05:06 AM) Quote #6 Gonna be rocking those keychains, for sure.

Honestly, I don't know, but game magazines from the late 80s in the U.S. were done by 20 somethings using fist or second generation Macs on a small budget. There was actually even more coverage of Tetris in EGM #1 a month earlier, May 1989. Edit: Video Games & Computer Entertainment magazine always had much more mature writing, as you can probably see here in their article 'Gaming and Glasnost" centered on Tetris from May 1990.

I think the local digital copy is more expensive than physical (and doesn't come out until May), and both are more expensive than MK8 physically due to some weirdness.

Ironically even though I usually always play with English dubs, I was really hoping for the JP dub for this game. The game is ridiculously priced on the JP eShop though, so I suppose I'll bite the bullet and just get the English.

I've been wanting to play it since it came out in Japan, and am so glad that I held off until now, because now I get to enjoy it with friends and GAF :D the demo is easily my most played game on the Switch after Zelda, can't believe how much mileage I got out of it. As someone who poured way more than 100 hours into Tetris DS which is IMO one of the finest puzzle games ever made, I hope to find that same sort of addiction here.
