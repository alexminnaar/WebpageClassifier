Too early to say. Much, much too early to say. Either one of them could burn out early as often happens to players who break through at a relatively young age to their peers. Let's just hope they don't both burn out early. I don't want to be all doom and gloom but it wouldn't be that uncommon. On the other hand the potential, if all goes well, looks pretty good for both. But these days success has so much to do with how dedicated and committed a player is to improving, how good and effective their support team is and how success they are avoiding injuries. None of this is knowable in advance without a crystal ball. One simply can't effectively predict which of two 18 year olds will have a better career, based solely on their current raw abilities. pov, DropShotAce, DcsabaS and 6 others like this.

So somewhere between Top 10 and Top 20. She also cant play that well on grass. honzaneumannn is offline   Quote Quick Reply post #9 of 61 (permalink) Old Jul 20th, 2017, 07:48 AM Viktymise King     Join Date: Jan 2006 Location: Flux Posts: 28,053                       Re: Who will be a better player: Bellis or Vondrousova?

Bellis is more complete player. Vond is just a bit more talented BBB. Bellis will have Aga like carreer and Vond more like Görges, i would draw such conclusion. 2_for_the_money is online now   Quote Quick Reply post #12 of 61 (permalink) Old Jul 20th, 2017, 09:08 AM gold fangs Senior Member   Join Date: Jul 2015 Posts: 3,281                       Re: Who will be a better player: Bellis or Vondrousova? This has the potential to be a really interesting rivalry at the top of the game. Both of them have unusually complete games for their age - even more so than the leaders of the excellent 1997 generation IMO. gold fangs is offline   Quote Quick Reply post #13 of 61 (permalink) Old Jul 20th, 2017, 10:52 AM Hugues Daniel -LIFETIME MEMBER-     Join Date: May 2013 Location: Manosque Posts: 27,052                       Re: Who will be a better player: Bellis or Vondrousova? Vondrousova has a bigger potential - taller, bigger strokes, with a kind of easiness in hitting them. Bellis looks to me like a more balanced kind of player in term of overall abilities, with a very strong forehand. Both are two different kind of players and will probably have to work differently to reach their best. I can envision Bellis as a new Wozniacki, and maybe she can work on her power again as well to hit strokes like Pierce, hard to say for now. I can envision Vondrousova as a player who will have highs and lows, but very high peaks like Kvitova. Also it's very, very possible that it's too soon to tell. I've talked too soon about Konjuh a few years ago. I thought she would rise faster, but she stagnated for a long while. She's still there, but she still doesn't play the best I envisioned from the impressive game she has. Because tennis is a complicated game that requires a lot of abilities and work. For instance, it seems Konjuh struggled essentially with movement/footwork. A lot of players have tremendous abilities but struggle with movement (Jabeur is another example). Quality of movement and footwork is extremely important in tennis. Still you can reach the number one spot without having movement as your best quality, if you know what I mean. But Pliskova's movement is underrated. She actually moves pretty well - and very smartly - for a player of her size and legs-size. It's her main weakness, still. If you make her move a lot she will struggle more. So kudos to her for knowing how to pull the best of her own abilities. She did the right thing and it paid off. I think all those players have to train their physical condition first and foremost. Tennis is a very injury-prone kind of sport. You have to be able to run for hours. It seems, to me, that the competitors are often exhausted too soon in best of 3 sets matches. No? Looks like my thoughts have moved from the original question, but anyway. Regarding movement/footwork: Wozniacki hasn't been number one for nothing. I'm surprised this point still remains a big mystery for honzaneuman and the likes (the ballbashing addicts). It's one of the least mysterious points of tennis to realize that movement and footwork are at the heart of this sport. Check the thread around about Steffi Graf while you're at it.

At this stage I'd say Vondrousova will have higher highs and lower lows with Bellis being more consistent. Who knows though really, way too early to tell. How many promising youngsters have failed to break through in recent years, or had a taste of success them retreated like Bouchard, or had their career completely derailed by injury like Robson. Way too many variables to predict anything with certainty. Shvedbarilescu and Perun like this. Kuznetsova ... for some reason.
