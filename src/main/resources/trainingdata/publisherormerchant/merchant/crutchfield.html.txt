Whether you're looking for a way to enjoy movies and music in your living room, bedroom, basement, or rec room, the Sony STR-DH550 will get you on the right track. Connect stereo or surround speakers to this receiver, along with your cable or satellite box, Blu-ray player, and streaming media device. HDMI connectivity ensures high-definition video and sound, while keeping your setup simple and easy to manage. There are also two subwoofer outputs, so you'll have the option of adding plenty of low-frequency rumble in larger rooms. Before you know it, you'll have a brand new room in your house: the home theater. Keep reading Home theater sound for any room Getting started with a home theater system doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. Whether you're looking for a way to enjoy movies and music in your living room, bedroom, basement, or rec room, the Sony STR-DH550 will get you on the right track. Connect stereo or surround speakers to this receiver, along with your cable or satellite box, Blu-ray player, and streaming media device. HDMI connectivity ensures high-definition video and sound, while keeping your setup simple and easy to manage. There are also two subwoofer outputs, so you'll have the option of adding plenty of low-frequency rumble in larger rooms. Before you know it, you'll have a brand new room in your house: the home theater. Plug in your Apple® or Android™ device With more people using smartphones and tablets for music and movies, it's great to have a receiver that can take advantage of them. The 'DH550 features a front-panel USB port for connecting an iPhone®, iPad®, or iPod®. Plug it in and control it with the receiver's remote, so you can listen to your digital music collection while your device charges. If you're an Android user, connect your compatible device to the MHL port. It's an HDMI input that can take video, photos, and music from portable devices and show them on the big screen and play them through your surround speakers. No more huddling around a smartphone to share a video with friends or family. Customized sound Sturdy binding posts make connecting speakers quick and easy, with bare wire or banana plug connectors — a rarity at this price point. Worried about getting evenly balanced surround sound from your speakers? Sony does the heavy lifting for you. The STR-DH550 features Digital Cinema Auto Calibration. That means the receiver can configure your speakers for optimum sound once you have them placed where you want them. Just plug in the included setup mic and follow the on-screen instructions for sound tailored to your room and speakers.

The STR-DH550 also includes dual LFE (mono-subwoofer) outputs for connecting two powered subs. Digital Cinema Auto Calibration (DCAC): The Sony STR-DH550 is equipped with Digital Cinema Auto Calibration Technology which uses the included microphone to automatically check the speaker connections, adjust the speaker output levels, calculate the distance from each speaker to the listening position, and distinguish frequency characteristics of each speaker. The microphone has an 15' cord attached that plugs into the microphone input on front of the receiver. You can also choose to manually adjust the AV receiver's speaker settings. Auto Format Direct (A.F.D.) Mode: The Auto Format Direct (A.F.D.) mode allows you to listen to high fidelity sound and select the decoding mode for listening to a 2-channel stereo sound as multi-channel. You can set the A.F.D. mode to Auto or Multi Stereo. A.F.D. Auto: Presets the sound as it was recorded/encoded without adding any surround effects. Multi Stereo: Outputs 2-channel left/right signals from all speakers. Dolby Digital/DTS/Dolby Pro Logic: The Sony STR-DH550 AV receiver features Dolby Digital and DTS-HD decoding, as well as offers Dolby Pro Logic audio processing. Dolby Digital: Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD DTS: DTS, DTS-HD Master Audio, DTS-HD High Resolution, DTS 96/24 Dolby Pro Logic: Dolby Pro Logic II Note: Dolby Digital and DTS listening modes can only be selected if your audio source is connected to the AV receiver via a digital audio connection (HDMI, optical, or coaxial). Even though the AV receiver will decode 7.1ch surround sound (via HDMI), it will only output 5.1ch surround, because it lacks Surround Back channel speaker outputs. HD Digital Cinema Sound (HD D.C.S): HD Digital Cinema Sound (HD-D.C.S.) is Sony's new innovative home theater technology using the latest acoustic and digital signal processing technologies. It is based on precise response measurement data of a mastering studio. With this mode, you are able to enjoy Blu-ray and DVD movies at home with not only the high quality of sound, but also the best sound ambience, just as the movie's sound engineer intended in the mastering process. For Movies: Dynamic: This setting is suitable for an environment which is reverberant but lacks a spacious feel (where sound absorption is not sufficient). It emphasizes the reflection of sound and reproduces the sound of a large, classic movie theater. This emphasizes the spacious feel of a dubbing theater and creates a unique acoustic field. Theater: This setting is suitable for a general living room. It reproduces the reverberation of sound just like in a movie theater (dubbing theater). It is most appropriate for watching content recorded on a Blu-ray Disc when you want the atmosphere of a movie theater. Studio: This setting is suitable for a living room with the appropriate sound devices. It reproduces the reverberation of sound provided when a theatrical sound source is remixed for a Blu-ray Disc to a volume level suitable for home use. The level of reflection and reverberation of sound is kept to a minimum, while dialogues and surround effects are reproduced vividly. For Music: Hall: Reproduces the acoustics of a classical concert hall. Jazz Club: Reproduces the acoustics of a jazz club. Live Concert: Reproduces the acoustics of a 300-seat live house. Stadium: Reproduces the feel of a large open-air stadium. Sports: Reproduces the feel of sports broadcasting. Portable Audio: Reproduces clear enhanced sound from your portable audio device. This mode is ideal for MP3s and other compressed music. Pure Direct: The receiver's Pure Direct mode outputs audio from only the front left and right speakers without any tone or DSP processing; only the volume and front speaker balance adjustments are active. Headphone Modes: The receiver offers two distinct headphone sound modes. HP 2CH: Sets the receiver to power only the front left and right speakers, no surround and no subwoofer. Two channel sources bypass the sound field processing and multi channel sources are down-mixed to 2 channels. HP Direct: Amplifies the source without any processing, only the volume and front speaker balance adjustments are active. Advanced Audio Settings: These advanced audio settings allow you to tailor the sound to your source content, listening conditions, and your personal preferences. Equalizer: You can adjust the tonal quality (bass & treble level) of the front speakers from -6dB to +6dB, in 1dB steps. Auto Volume: Auto Volume adjust the volume automatically depending on the input signal or content from the connected equipment. This function is useful, for example, when the sound of a commercial is louder than the TV programs. Dynamic Range Compressor: This feature allows you to compress the dynamic range of the sound track. You can select standard or maximum compression, or off (only works with Dolby Digital sources). Night Mode: This function allows you to retain a theater like environment at low volume levels. When watching a movie late at night, you will still be able to hear the dialog clear even at a low volume level. Audio Inputs/Outputs: The Sony STR-DH550 offers a variety of analog and digital audio inputs/outputs. Digital Inputs: The receiver has two optical digital inputs and one coaxial digital inputs (all assignable). You can choose auto decoding or PCM for the digital audio inputs. Auto will decode the signal in its original form (Dolby Digital, DTS, PCM, etc), PCM decodes the signal to 2-channel. All of the digital audio jacks are compatible with 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, and 96 kHz sampling frequencies. Speaker Outputs: The receiver is equipped with binding post terminals for all speaker channels. The binding post terminals will accept bare wire, pin connectors, and banana plugs (single only). Use speakers with a 6- to 16-ohm impedance. Dual Sub Outputs: The AV receiver is fitted with two subwoofer preamp outputs to connect dual powered subs (the subwoofer outputs share the same input signal and are not discrete). Headphones: When headphones are plugged into the full-size 1/4" jack on the front panel, all the speakers are automatically muted. No sound is output from the headphones when iPod or iPhone is connected to the receiver. Video Features HDMI 2.0: The receiver is equipped with four HDMI (v.2.0) inputs for connecting HDMI-equipped audio/video component; such as your satellite/cable receiver, Blu-ray/DVD player, and game system. It also allows you to connect all of your devices to your TV with a single HDMI cable via its ARC-compatible HDMI monitor output, reducing cable clutter. The receiver's HDMI v.2.0 jacks are compatible with 4K/60Hz and 1080p video, 3D video signals, Deep Color & x.v.Color technology; as well as LipSync, ARC, and HDMI control. 4K/60Hz Pass Through: 4K/60Hz Pass Through allows the Sony STR-DH550 to receive ultra high-definition resolution video and pass the video signal to a 4K/60Hz compatible TV or display monitor. 3D-Ready: The Sony STR-DH550 is compatible with 3D-ready Blu-ray disc movies, video games, and other 3D content through its HDMI (v.1.4) connections. 3D viewing requires 3D-ready source with 3D content, 3D-ready HDTV, 3D glasses, and high-speed HDMI cable. Other 3D accessories may also be needed. Deep/x.v.Color Support: The Sony AV receiver also supports Deep Color and x.v.Color content, which can display a larger color range than standard-definition schemes. The result is a more lifelike, vibrant picture. A/V Sync: The audio output can be delayed so that the time gap between the audio output and the visual display is minimized. This is especially helpful when you are using a large LCD or plasma TV or a projection TV. When activated, the delay is fixed at 60 ms. ARC (Audio Return Channel): This feature allows audio to be sent from your compatible HDTV to your receiver through the same HDMI cable already being used to send audio and video to your HDTV. This eliminates the need for extra cables connected to your television. Note: The AV receiver's HDMI 2.0 jacks do not support the latest HDCP 2.2 copyright protection for 4K ultra-HD content, so it will not support 4K content from satellite/cable providers, online video services, and Blu-ray disc which are copyright protected with HDCP 2.2. 24p True Cinema Mode: The 24p True Cinema Mode allows you to watch movies at their native frame rate 24p format (24 frames per second) when paired with a 24p playback device like a Blu-ray Disc Player. MHL Compatible HDMI: One of the receiver's rear-panel HDMI inputs (labeled "Video/MHL") is MHL compatible, which provides direct connection of MHL compatible smartphones, like your Android smartphone. Playback of up to 1080p video and multi-channel audio from the phone is supported. The receiver will also charge (5V/1A) your connected phone. Play, Stop, and other basic operations can be controlled from the AV receiver's remote control. HDMI Standby Pass-Through: The HDMI Standby Pass-Through feature conveniently allows you to access all your HDMI connected devices without having to power on the receiver. Composite Video Inputs: The Sony STR-DH550 is also fitted with two analog composite video inputs and one composite video monitor output. The composite video jacks support 480i video signals only. USB/iPod Functions Front-Panel USB Port: This AV receiver is equipped with a front-panel USB (type-A) port that allows you to enjoy WAV (8-48kHz; 16-bit), MP3 (32-320kbps), WMA (48-192kbps), and AAC (48-320kbps)music files from a USB mass storage class memory device; such as your Android smartphone (Froyo/Gingerbread OS only), Sony Walkman, or USB thumbdrive. The receiver can recognize up to 256 folders and 256 files in each folder. You can use the receiver's on-screen menu (via HDMI) and remote control to navigate your stored music files on your connected USB memory device. USB portable audio devices that can be charged via USB will be charged when plugged into the AV receiver's USB port (5V/1A); even in standby mode. iPod/iPhone Direct: The Sony STR-DH550 supports digital music playback from an iPod, iPhone, or iPad using its front-panel USB (type-A) port. Simply plug your compatible Apple device into the receiver's front-panel USB port, using the cable that came with your iPod/iPhone/iPad. Stored music and music apps from your connected Apple device can be played through the AV receiver, bypassing the iPod/iPhone D/A converter for better sound quality. The iPod/iPhone/iPad can be controlled by the receiver's remote, or you can continue to use the Apple device's clickwheel or touchscreen. You can search for stored music on your compatible Apple device by Playlist, Artist, Album, Song, Podcast, Genre, Composer, or Audiobook. You also have access to Repeat (One/All/Off) and Shuffle (Songs/Albums/Off) functions. The receiver offers limited control (Play/Pause, Previous/Next Track) of music apps on your iPod/iPhone. Song/artist information from stored music and music apps on your iPod/iPhone will display on your connected TV via HDMI.

Each preset station can be given an 8 character name. Input Naming: You can enter a name of up to 8 characters for each of the receiver's inputs (except Tuner) and display the name on its display. This is convenient for labeling the jacks with the names of your connected components. Sleep Timer: The unit may be set to automatically turn off after 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes. Auto Standby: Auto Standby lets you set the receiver switch to standby mode automatically after 30 minutes when you do not operate the receiver or when there is no signal input to the receiver.

But, using the remote, press home, then settings / speaker settings / manual set up / front left /enter / level / enter.....you can adjust the speaker level and distance.Do the same for each speaker But, it still doesn't make sense to me. If you are getting a test tone from each speaker, you should be getting sound in each speaker. Have you looked at the online manual? Possibly something wrong with the receiver? Wish I could be of more help. [ Donald  Apr 01, 2017 ] I find it is very difficult to adjust settings manually. I'm sure it can be done but have not had the patience to try. I use the sensor mic that came with it and it does an excellent job. Sorry I can't help more. [ octobertommy  Apr 01, 2017 ] YEs just go into main menu for speaker volume.

[ Krissy  Feb 07, 2017 ]  Staff 2 answers Is there an aftermarket remote that can control the center and surround speakers without having to go into the receiver's menu? I am replacing a 21 year old Sony receiver that can do this, i.e., independently control the volume of the center channel and surround speakers with dedicated buttons for these channels on the remote. [ Tracy  Dec 12, 2016 ] I think only Sony remotes work with this amp. It comes with a remote so I am confused as to why you would need another? I have had mine for a long time and it still provides excellent service. There is a plug in (included) that automatically balances the sound and I find that very handy. Sorry I could not give you a more accurate answer. [ octobertommy  Dec 15, 2016 ] I don't know since I have never adjusted them from initial setup. Since I mostly deaf I am not to up on sound adjustments. I do use a harmony remote from Logitech and it is very customizable so I think it could be programmed to do what you want. [ Richard  Dec 15, 2016 ] 1 answer What, exactly, does "two channels driven" mean? I want to know the watts to each speaker: left, right, center, and the rear speakers. How do I find out the breakdown of wattages to each speaker? [ Tracy  Nov 21, 2016 ] You need an audiophile to answer this. This receiver does a great job with my TV, BD and 5.1 surround. [ PAUL J  Nov 21, 2016 ] 1 answer can I attach a 2nd set of speakers to my Sony 5.2 center speaker channel ? [ Glenn  Nov 07, 2016 ] The center channel is only for 1 speaker. If you want to use the receiver for stereo reception with two speakers, the instruction manual tells you how to connect. Not sure if more than one speaker per channel would work, but you do get plenty of wattage per channel with this amplifier.

[ Krissy  Aug 29, 2016 ]  Staff 2 answers I have a Sonos Connect hooked up to the CD input and I have the Fios box connected to the SAT HDMI input, and then I have the HDMI out going to my LG UHD TV. The problem I'm having is that I cant listen to music and at the same time just have the TV on mute with a game on b/c when I switch the input to CD to listen to music, the HDMI output to the TV stops. Any suggestions? [ WDice  Jun 16, 2016 ] Hi, I reviewed my setting for the receiver, and I don't think that Sony has thought this through. I do not think there is a way to watch something passed through the HDMI cable from the receiver to the TV, and to also listen to CDs. The receiver just can't do that. The only solution would be to port the device directly into the TV, and then use the receiver to listen to the CDs. Another example of how the receiver's limitation is a drawback... I have a Roku stick plugged into a port on the receiver. I like to watch a feed from NASA of their earth pinted camera from the ISS, the International Space Station. They tell you that there's no audio, but that I can pipe in whatever music I'd like to, as I watch the video feed of the earth below. Well, I can't do that, unless I port the Roku stick directly to the TV, and, TV manufacturers, well aware of most people now using HDMI pass through receivers, have gone from giving 3 or 4 HDMI ports to just 2. So there you are... [ ALAN  Jun 18, 2016 ] You can't use your receiver as a switch box in your scenario. Run the HDMI cable to the TV first and then you will be able yo do what you want by running HDMI from the TV to the receiver.

I want to connect 4 HDMI video devices, but also one optical (Sonos) and one RCA (phono w/preamp) will that work? [ Benjamin  Feb 09, 2016 ] Yes you have 4 separate HDMI input with 2 optical input. The phono spec Analog: Sensitivity: 500 mV/50 kilohms S/N (*3): 105 dB (A, 500 mV (*4)), since I do not know your spec of your turntable not sure. It's a very nice receiver for the cost. [ AMOS  Feb 10, 2016 ] If your question is relative to physical separation then absolutely yes, check out the picture of the back of the unit on the product page. While I haven't the exact set up you want I think input choices should be easy with the remote.

Here's what Sony says about that jack.., so I'm guessing it's video only. Don't take my word for it.., ck the manual to be sure (manual online) Sony says; An input that lets you connect any device with a coaxial digital output. Though coaxial digital connections use standard RCA-style jacks, a coaxial digital audio cable designed specifically for the wider frequency bandwidth of digital signals is recommended.

[ Mark  Jul 14, 2015 ] the unit is not DNLA capable, you will need to connect another device that is DNLA compatible. The USB port plays audio files from a USB drive in many formats including WAV and MP3, and is also compatible with iOS devices. [ JASON  Dec 23, 2015 ] No it won't. I tried myself. After checking the manual it is only for Apple devices with USB capabilities, like a IPOD. [ THELORD  Jul 19, 2015 ] 3 answers Can i connect a yamaha sound bar to this for sound?

[ JEROLD N.  Jun 20, 2015 ] I don't know what a sound bar is> But I have the owner's manual to mine and would look into the issue if you were more specific. My DH550 is running fine. [ Kenneth A.  Jun 20, 2015 ] 2 answers Will this work with a 4k TV? [ Dorothea  May 27, 2015 ] Yes, this receiver will work for the surround sound however I would recommend the Sony STR DN850 as a better option for a 4K TV. I have both of these receivers and they both perform great. There are two big differences between the two. The 850 is easier to hook up to you 4K TV as you will only need one Hi Speed HDMI cable to hook up the receiver to the TV for video and sound plus the 850 also has WIFI. [ Dale  May 30, 2015 ] I sent it back. I have no idea. I have a den non. Just call Sony. They will be happy to tell you..or better still read the specs in the manuel [ Michael  May 28, 2015 ] 7 answers Can this receiver acept banana plugs instead of plain speaker wire? [ rickyqueens,nyc  May 11, 2015 ] Yes it can. [ Nick  May 14, 2015 ] Yes. Ms peaked connectors will accept bare wire or banana plugs. [ DANNY  May 13, 2015 ] Yes it can - I do not know about dual plugs. I use single banana plugs on it. [ PATRICK  May 11, 2015 ] Yes. (see notes from the Crutchfield website too) Getting started with a home theater system doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. Whether you're looking for a way to enjoy movies and music in your living room, bedroom, basement, or rec room, the Sony STR-DH550 will get you on the right track. Connect stereo or surround speakers to this receiver, along with your cable or satellite box, Blu-ray player, and streaming media device. HDMI connectivity ensures high-definition video and sound, while keeping your setup simple and easy to manage. There are also two subwoofer outputs, so you'll have the option of adding plenty of low-frequency rumble in larger rooms. Before you know it, you'll have a brand new room in your house: the home theater. Plug in your Apple® or AndroidT device With more people using smartphones and tablets for music and movies, it's great to have a receiver that can take advantage of them. The 'DH550 features a front-panel USB port for connecting an iPhone®, iPad®, or iPod®. Plug it in and control it with the receiver's remote, so you can listen to your digital music collection while your device charges. If you're an Android user, connect your compatible device to the MHL port. It's an HDMI input that can take video, photos, and music from portable devices and show them on the big screen and play them through your surround speakers. No more huddling around a smartphone to share a video with friends or family. Sturdy binding posts make connecting speakers quick and easy, with bare wire or banana plug connectors - a rarity at this price point. Worried about getting evenly balanced surround sound from your speakers? Sony does the heavy lifting for you. The STR-DH550 features Digital Cinema Auto Calibration. That means the receiver can configure your speakers for optimum sound once you have them placed where you want them. Just plug in the included setup mic and follow the on-screen instructions for sound tailored to your room and speakers. [ TONY  May 11, 2015 ] Yes, that is what I used. [ Todd  May 11, 2015 ] Yes, banana plugs should work [ KYLE  May 11, 2015 ] Yes, it does accept banana plugs. [ EDWARD A  May 11, 2015 ] 1 answer The specs state this unit has HDMI 2.0 but nowhere else, including SONY, I can't find HDMI 2.0 to be confirmed. Could Crutchfield please look into this and confirm if this unit in fact has 50 and 60fps HDMI 2.0? [ Huseyin  Mar 27, 2015 ] You can see the video output options in the manual. It is on the 9th page here: http://pix.crutchfield.com/Manuals/158/158STDH550.PDF [ Jeff  Mar 30, 2015 ]  Staff 1 answer What subwoofer is compatible with the str-dh550? [ Nick  Mar 06, 2015 ] This receiver has 2 subwoofer outputs, and will be compatible with any of the powered subwoofers on the market. You can find powered subs here: http://www.crutchfield.com/g_12300/Powered-Subwoofers.html?tp=187 [ Jeff  Mar 06, 2015 ]  Staff 2 answers What is the headphone plug size on this unit? 1/4" or 6.35mm or some other size hole? [ MorrisGray  Mar 02, 2015 ] Head phone jack is the standard 1/4" jack under the power button on left side. [ RICHARD L  Mar 04, 2015 ] The headphone jack is the standard 1/4 in [ Dale  Mar 04, 2015 ] 4 answers Is it possible to turn off the un- used inputs so there would be less to scroll though when switching devices? [ Ryan-  Feb 01, 2015 ] I don't think so. I can't find an option for that. [ MIKE  Feb 02, 2015 ] I'm sorry I don't know the answer to this. Personally, I'm using most of the inputs. [ JEROLD N.  Feb 02, 2015 ] (Hit enter to soon) all in all, it's a really great unit in my opinion and plays great (connectivity) with othe sony products. This unit is connected to a Sony 60 " kdl 60ex701. [ TONY  Feb 01, 2015 ] Not that I can see. I use the primary hdmi 1-3 and have those inputs auto to Dolby surround. I always seem to keep the same environment regardless of my input. [ TONY  Feb 01, 2015 ] 2 answers Does this unit have the ability to drive all speakers at once or is just stereo, dolby dig., etc.? My old Pioneer has an option called 5 that drives all speakers together which I do use quite a bit. [ Bart  Jan 15, 2015 ] I currently have two bookshelf speakers and a sub woofer. So far, it does drive all speakers simultaneously. It also has Dolby Digital setting. You have to figure out which setting is most pleasing to you. I'm saving up to buy a center-channel speaker. I'll update my reply after I test it out. I don't have any serious complaints about this unit. [ SAM  Jul 12, 2015 ] I forwarded your question to an Advisor and they responded with the following: The Sony receiver does have a multi channel stereo that sounds like what your Pioneer might have been doing. Sony describes it like this: Multi Stereo: Outputs 2-channel left/right signals from all speakers. If you would like to discuss further you can contact an Advisor directly by phone (1-800-324-9695) or online chat. [ Krissy  Jan 21, 2015 ]  Staff 7 answers Can I use the this amp with just 2 speakers? I have a current Kenwood 5.1 amp I need to replace that I am able to run with a simulated "center" channel. It works nicely with a set of bose speakers I ahve. [ Steve  Jan 13, 2015 ] yes you can use this with two speakers. There are several different speaker modes you can choose from. I have been using this receiver for almost a month now and it has been great.I would highly recommend this because For the price you can't beat it and you always have the flexibility of using it for surround sound down the road. [ CYNTHIA  Jan 16, 2015 ] I am using mine in a 3.1 setup and it sounds great. My two devices output 5.1 and the receiver adjusts the sound really well to 3.1. I can see a setting in the calibration settings for 2.0 and 2.1 so I would assume it works the same. [ David  Jan 16, 2015 ] Yes you can use as a conventional 2 channel receiver. [ JAMES  Jan 15, 2015 ] I would think so. But if I were you I would contact customer support at Crutchfield & you can chat with them online & I feel sure they can answer your question. I am using all channels on mine & it is by far the best receiver I have owned. I chatted with them online & they helped me decide the best replacement system for my old one & I am very sastified. Hope this helps. [ ROBERT  Jan 14, 2015 ] I just bought this amp and am using it to run two Pioneer bookshelf speakers--that's all I wanted--and it's working beautifully. [ PAUL  Jan 14, 2015 ] No problem with 2 channel setup. That is how mine is currently connected. I got it for the USB, not the 5.2 capability. [ STEVE  Jan 14, 2015 ] Yes, you can. I currently have only a left and right hooked up to this receiver and it sounds really good. The receiver has a setting for stereo or 5.1. For the price (I paid 199) it's a good receiver. [ Frank Worsham  Jan 14, 2015 ] 4 answers All the reviews talk about the audio quality. How is the video quality when using this receiver? I am using an Onyko and HDMI projector on a 16' x 9' screen. Onkyo doesn't handle the color well (it is much better with my Yamaha receiver). Any comparative color observation? Thanks. [ John  Jan 09, 2015 ] Unless you spent $5,000 on a projector... that is the problem. Get an 80" flat screen LED TV and you will be blown away by the color. The Sony receiver does a good job on the audio. But, you must know it is an "entry level" receiver. My audio is outstanding with the receiver but you must have top performing speakers. My speakers are NHT's at $250 per left/right front and rear speakers. The center speaker is $350.00. I have an M&K 75w subwoofer. The Sony receiver and these speakers produce sound that is hard to believe. Projection TVs are an older concept and are fading away... [ JOE  Jan 12, 2015 ] Hi John W. The main reason I bought this specific receiver is because I needed a receiver that could pass through a 3D audio signal. I didn't know that this was such an unusual function - but my Denon receiver couldn't do it. The TV I'm viewing is a new Sony KDL-60W850B 3D TV. I'm very happy with the total set-up. I can honestly say I don't see any picture difference between running the signal from my DirecTV input HDMI vs. running the signal through my new Sony STR-DH550 and back to my TV. [ PAUL  Jan 11, 2015 ] I have no comparison. I'm using my Sony for 2 channel audio only right now. I do have and older model Onkyo TX-SR 806.That I use in my living room home theater and it works beautifully since buying it from Crutchfield back in 2010 or 2011. Hope this helps. [ rickyqueens,nyc  Jan 09, 2015 ] I have had this unit for 5 weeks very pleased with both the audio and video qualithy. [ WILLIAM W  Jan 09, 2015 ] 1 answer Can I plug a rg6 cable into this unit? This rg6 is from a roof antenna and or cable company, in a rv [ Dale  Jan 05, 2015 ] I forwarded your question to an Advisor and they responded with the following: That Sony receiver does not have the inputs necessary for an RG-6 connection. In most cases you would run that RG-6 cable to a cable box and from the Cable Box to the receiver with one of the available inputs. Or directly to a TV. The "Coax" style connection on that Sony is for an FM antenna. If you would like to discuss further you can contact an Advisor directly by phone (1-800-324-9695) or online chat. [ Krissy  Jan 07, 2015 ]  Staff 5 answers I just exchanged a comparable Denon receiver for this unit, and my first impressions are VERY favorable! One issue I can't figure out, tho, is how to stream digital radio from my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone thru this unit. The Denon has BluTooth so it was simple. From what I can see, I can only connect (via the front USB ) ipod, iPhone, or Sony products?. Any suggestions would be appreciated. [ Rob M  Jan 03, 2015 ] No Bluetooth but if you have a Samsung TV you can use the screen mirroring function to stream audio and video from your Samsung Galaxy. ..nice because you will see the album art on tv [ DENNIS P  Jan 08, 2015 ] Hi Rob, I purchased this Sony around Thanksgiving. So far it's been great. However you are correct, this receiver doesn't have BT. The only way to connect is via front USB. You can then control the Ipod/Iphone via the Sony remote. The good news it works well and really isn't a hassle. [ HARVEY R  Jan 06, 2015 ] I've only had mine since Nov. and since Sony doesn't include instructions, we, the customers, are screwed. If it wasn't for Crutchfield helping me figure it out, I might have sent it back. As to your question, I don't have smart phones or anything of the kind. Best I can offer is find some way to make Sony admit they made the thing and stand behind it with help and instructions. Good Luck [ WARREN H  Jan 05, 2015 ] That's the best way to do it, the other way would be to connect it with RCA connectors to the back of the unit through the ear phone jack [ Jenelle R  Jan 05, 2015 ] I don't have a smart phone so I don't know. [ JOHN  Jan 05, 2015 ] 4 answers Seems this product does not have an Ethernet port -- (i) how important are firmware updates, and (ii) if updates are important, how are they installed (if at all)? [ Jack W  Dec 20, 2014 ] Not that important. If it is important, you should step up to a video up scale receiver. More $ [ ROGER  Dec 21, 2014 ] There is no Ethernet port. This is a basic good value unit with 4 HDMI inputs and 1 out as well as 2 sub outputs. I purchased it for my patio and are not looking for the best sound field adjustments. I have a DA5800ES in the house for that performance with Ethernet which requires a complete receiver reboot if you get an update or the sound is a mess. hope this helps. Rick [ RICHARD L  Dec 21, 2014 ] The product does have a USB port that can be used for updates loaded onto a flash drive. I haven't had to make any since buying the unit. [ Nick  Dec 21, 2014 ] Jack, I have not yet installed this product on my Entertainment system. So I don't know how firmware updates are handled. Sorry I couldn't help more. [ MICHAEL  Dec 21, 2014 ] 8 answers Does this product have on-screen display? [ MarkG  Dec 19, 2014 ] yes [ FELTON  Dec 20, 2014 ] yes, a simple scroll [ RICHARD D  Dec 20, 2014 ] Yes Mark, there are on screen display options to choose from [ JAMES  Dec 20, 2014 ] Yes it does display on your tv. [ JEROLD N.  Dec 19, 2014 ] Yes. It displays the name of the song. I think it is a great product that drives my speakers with crystal clear sound. Well made, [ MICHAEL A  Dec 19, 2014 ] Hi Mark, Yes, the Sony STR-DH550 does have an on-screen display, if you connect the receiver to your television with an HDMI cable. Ed [ EDWARD A  Dec 19, 2014 ] Yes, it displays volume level etc. on the TV screen. [ MIKE  Dec 19, 2014 ] Yes [ TODD D  Dec 19, 2014 ] 5 answers when you push the 'speaker' button on the front, does that give you alternatives between what used to be 'A' and 'B' speaker output and what is now surround front and rear? [ sidney  Nov 18, 2014 ] Hi Sid, The speaker button on the front panel, when pushed, will simply turn the speakers on, or when pushed again, turn the speakers off (if you prefer to listen via headphones). There is no "B" channel on this model for an additional pair of speakers. You would have to step up to the Sony STR-DH750 to have this feature. [ EDWARD A  Nov 19, 2014 ] thank you very much [ sidney  Nov 19, 2014 ] thank you very much [ sidney  Nov 19, 2014 ] That button is just on/ off there is not an A or B switch [ TODD D  Nov 19, 2014 ] Pressing the speaker button turns all speakers off and then on with another press. [ DANNY  Nov 19, 2014 ] 1 answer i have a rca 32 720p tv will this reciver work with it and what is the best speakers to use with it ? [ Kareem  Aug 25, 2014 ] I forwarded your question to an Advisor and they responded with the following: As long as your TV had HDMI inputs the receiver will work with it. If it doesn't have HDMI, you can check to see if it has an Optical Digital audio output. That would work with the receiver as well. We have a great deal on the Energy Micro speaker system right now that would work well with the power of this receiver: http://www.crutchfield.com/p_732RCMIC/Energy-RC-Micro-5-1.html?tp=184 If you would like to discuss further you can contact an Advisor directly by phone (1-800-324-9695) or online chat. [ Krissy  Aug 27, 2014 ]  Staff 1 answer Do non-powered subwoofers also work? [ Stephen  Jul 30, 2014 ] We have not received any answers from other customers on your question. I would recommend reaching out to an Advisor by phone (1-800-324-9695) or online chat. They should be able to help answer your question. [ Krissy  Aug 05, 2014 ]  Staff 2 answers Will I be able to connect a turntable to this unit? [ Ron  Jul 22, 2014 ] You can attach turntable to any of the red/white RCA inputs. However if you use an input with the same label as the HDMI the receiver will probably default to the HDMI if something is plugged in to it. My receivers do this anyway. You may not get the best sound without a phono input unfortunately, but it will work [ MICHAEL D  Aug 02, 2014 ] If the turntable has RCA stereo outputs, it'll work no problem. [ KYLE  Jul 22, 2014 ] 12 answers Does this come with a remote? [ John  Jul 13, 2014 ] Yes it does [ JAMES  Jul 19, 2014 ] Yes [ STEVEN  Jul 16, 2014 ] Yes it does. [ EDDIE  Jul 15, 2014 ] Yes, a full function remote is included. [ JEROLD N.  Jul 15, 2014 ] Yes. [ RICHARD D  Jul 14, 2014 ] Yes. The unit comes with a basic remote control. [ DANNY  Jul 14, 2014 ] Yes, and it is a full size one to boot. [ Todd  Jul 14, 2014 ] Yes it does. [ RODNEY  Jul 14, 2014 ] Yes, it does come with a remote. [ EDWARD A  Jul 14, 2014 ] Yes, it does come with a remote. And it's one of the more straight forward remotes I've seen with a series of buttons at the top to switch inputs. One button for each input rather than one button to scroll through inputs. [ JAY  Jul 14, 2014 ] Yes. [ MICHAEL R.  Jul 14, 2014 ] Yes it does [ TODD D  Jul 14, 2014 ] 4 answers Am I able to connect my sony sacd player to it? [ Robert  Jun 09, 2014 ] Yes I have...enjoying the system...great sound, easy to operate. I did have it professionally installed. [ MILDRED  Jun 16, 2014 ] Well Robert.... I don't have a clue what a scad player is. But the system works great with big screen tv and all the theater stuff!! [ JOHN C  Jun 11, 2014 ] I myself, do not have a CD player hooked up to this unit at this time, but there are component jacks marked ( AS CD / CD ) in the rear. I would proabaly have to say yes. Good Luck [ MICHAEL W  Jun 10, 2014 ] yes optically. [ RICHARD D  Jun 10, 2014 ] 1 answer Does 6 1/4" height include the feet? I have an open cabinet. But, if 6 1/4" includes the feet, I only have about 1 1/4" space above. If it doesn't include the feet, I'll have very little space above. I would install external fans to pull the hot air out. With that installed, is about an inch enough space for air flow? [ Anders  Apr 05, 2014 ] I forwarded your question to an Advisor and they responded with the following: Yes the measurements do include the feet. It would be best to get as much air to the receiver as you can, you dont want it to overheat. Having a cabinet with an open back should be fine. If you would like to discuss further you can contact an Advisor directly by phone (1-800-324-9695) or online chat.
