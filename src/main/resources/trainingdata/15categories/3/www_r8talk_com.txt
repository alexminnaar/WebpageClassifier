Perhaps because it has been so hectic over the past few months that it quickly grew so familiar, putting on over 6,000 miles of commuting, comparing, shuttling the kids around and even a short road trip up to ski country.

In winter, its surely a wonderland playground for the wealthy skiers and snowboarders who visit from neighboring France or Spain. But were here in the summer and the slopes are all covered in lush foliage, with the only apparent sign of life in the sleepy villages being a few random mountain bikers or motorcyclists. A glimpse at the GPS shows a network of roads in Andorra that looks more like a pot of cooked spaghetti than a means by which to get people from point A to point B. In other words, its paradise for those who enjoy a good automotive flogging. As luck would have it, we were there to do just that with Audis newest high-performance RS 5 coupe.
