I have not been making updates to any of my image archives nor the blog. Currently the images for all these sites are in at least three different servers. I think all of the MCIA is on Jkaris' server which is excellent. But images from some of the other archives (BEB, Greek Beasts, BBSD, etc) and the blog are also on Flickr and Photobucket. I'm going to be ending my subscription to those two sites. That means that those images will no longer show up on the archives and the blog. All of these sites still get traffic. If anybody is interested in taking over these sites, I would be very willing to pass the reigns. Hell, maybe the LRG community at large would be interested. You'd be free to use the images in any way you saw fit. You could replace all of them with close up shots of Doc's asscheeks if you'd like! DM or email me, and I will check back here occasionally.
