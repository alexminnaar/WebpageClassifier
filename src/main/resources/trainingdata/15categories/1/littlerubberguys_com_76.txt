They serve as kind of a companion set to the upcoming Universe of Violence line, and an ode to my love of gross out lines, like GPK and Boglins, and such. Also, they hover at about 1". I've got designs for a bunch more, so if you guys snatch them up, we'll keep making more of them. As for colorways? Eric (casting genius) is going to be doing them up, in whatever colors he feels like. It's going to be really random, and to be honest, half of the fun for us, will be seeing if you guys come up with some crazy algorithm figuring out a pattern. You guys are always good for that. Anyways, here's the second look at them (Eric posted a "spoiler" in the Alan Maskbox, and if you don't look at the Alan Maskbox, shame on you), I hope you guys enjoy. We're going to be releasing these in three packs, each figure being represented in random colors. Price point? $12 and shipping. That's about as low as we could go, with covering materials, but we didn't want to price anybody who wanted these out.

The little kid in me is screaming in joy at the gore just for the sake of gore. Could you add a pic of your guys standing next to something like OMFG guys?
