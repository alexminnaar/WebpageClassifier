FBBO is the premiere online resource for Classic B Body Mopar Enthusiasts. The Chrysler B platform was the basis for rear-wheel drive Chrysler cars from 1962 through 1979. All of the B-body cars in a given model year for either make were built upon the same chassis. However, the outward design differed between makes. The Plymouth B-body series ultimately comprised four cars with nearly identical outward appearances (differing only in trim package, drive train and accessories). These were the Belvedere, Satellite, GTX and Road Runner. The Superbird was a Road Runner with an extended nose and a high-mounted rear wing. It was the only Plymouth B-body that looked essentially different from the others. There was more diversity in the outward appearance of the Dodge B-body series. The Dodge models based on the B-body were the Coronet, Super Bee and the Charger. The Charger Daytona was a Charger with an extended nose and high-mounted rear wing.
