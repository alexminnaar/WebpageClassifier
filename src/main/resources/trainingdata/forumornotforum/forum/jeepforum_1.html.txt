(Including Gallery of Winners) Here are the rules of the game, if you cannot follow them to the exact dot - you will be automatically disqualified for the month. RULES: *UPDATED-1/1/2013* In an effort to minimize future headaches, only members who have at least 25 tech posts or premium members will be allowed to vote. Big thanks to PhilipB for implementing this. • JK Unlimiteds will be allowed every month regardless • All pictures submitted must be hosted on your own with working links or you will be disqualified. (URL's only please, [IMG] tags not required) • Please submit high quality pictures, your chance at winning could possibly be lessened by a poor quality picture. • You are allowed to submit a maximum of 3 pictures for entries, if submitted more than 3 we will pick 3 at random. • ALL entries must be sent to the provided Email address • There are NO classes, if you did not win because you got beat out by someone on 1 tons and 42" tires. I'm sorry, but they won’t be able to enter next month so try again. • Winners cannot enter again till the following year • Those who did not win can resubmit as many times as they want in the following months • (OPTIONAL) along with your 3 pictures you can send in a list of specifications and a story on how it came to be, so if you got something sweet let us know what it is! • At the end of the year all jeeps that won the previous months will be automatically entered for JK of The Year. Those 12 entries will be voted on for 10 days concluding on New Year’s Eve with the new winner. (December’s contest will be shortened slightly to allow JKoTY) The top 3 JK of The Year winners will be awarded Premium 1 year memberships on JF • Slander will not be tolerated under any condition or reason. Those caught bad mouthing others in the contest will be disqualified • Posting additional pictures will not be tolerated. You are allotted 3 pictures for the contest - keep it that way. • Company owned or sponsored rigs will not be allowed to submit. It is unfair to everyone else who operates on a budget. • You may not under any circumstances ask for votes AT ALL. Not on JF, not via email, not on other forums, etc. Anything that a judge deems is for solicitation purposes will result in an immediate disqualification. • New entrants are given emphasis when being chosen for top 10 • This is not a popularity contest, this is to see who feels who's Jeep is the best • It is your responsibility to help make sure the contest is known about (aka CRAWL it!!)

For the Month of June 2010 Story: Bought this brand new at Bricktop’s dealership in Vancouver WA and pulled the stock 3.8L out of it immediately. Got some input from Burnsville Offroad for the Hemi swap, and made the rest up as we went. The majority of the work was done locally here in Vancouver WA by Fast Specialties with some help from Hannah Jeep along the way. I’m sure I missed some mods but I got the main ones. The jump in one of my pics did a little damage, but nothing too bad. Broke a driveshaft up at Brown’s Camp this past weekend so it’s in for a little R&R at the moment, but I’ll be out wheeling again in no time. It’s my daily driver and my wheeling rig so it won’t be down for long. Thanks for taking the time to check out my Jeep. .

Now we have his and her JKs, the old TJ, a 3 car wedge trailer, and a 1 ton dually to pull everything. We spend as many as 4 weeks a year wheeling as a family in Moab and other locales, plus another 9-10 weekends a year with our local 4x4 club. I bought my JK so my son could use our 04 TJ as his high school daily driver. The purpose behind my 2 door JK build has been low center of gravity with good flex and stability because it is my daily driver. I would not hesitate to drive it 800 miles to Moab, wheel it hard for a week, and drive the 800 miles home.

MY WIFE AND I TRADED IN THE TOW RIG (05 SUPERDUTY 6.0), SOLD THE TRAILER AND BOUGHT THIS LOADED RUBICON UNLIMITED. I PARTED OUT THE TOYOTA SOLD WHAT I COULD AND GAVE THE REST AWAY TO MAKE ROOM IN THE GARAGE. WE USED THE MONEY THAT I MADE ON THE TOYOTA TO FUND THIS BUILD. IT HAS BEEN REALLY FUN AND STRESSFULL BUT AS YOU CAN SEE I THINK IT TURNED OUT OK FOR WHAT I HAD TO WORK WITH. EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE I DID MY SELF IN MY 2 CAR GARAGE OVER A 4 DAY PERIOD. SINCE I HAVE FINISHED THIS STAGE OF THE BUILD I HAVE NOTICED A FEW FLAWS IN THE BUILD, I FIRST STARTED WITH 4.88 GEARS.... BAD IDEA! MPG WENT SOUTH REALLY BAD AND DRIVABILITY WAS HORRIBLE. I SINCE REGEARED IT AGIAN WITH 5.38'S AND WE ARE MUCH HAPPIER WITH THE DRIVABILITY AND MPG. I AM STILL FINE TUNING EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT WORK THE WAY I WANT IT TO. THERE IS MORE TO COME BUT WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR NOW......

I think like Harley Davidsons, a Jeep can then be modified to what the user wants, needs and likes best. After picking up the JK in Nov 2007 I kept the Jeep stock for the first year of wheeling to decide what I wanted and needed to run the trails I like to be on. I am a member of the El Jebel Shrine Jeep Patrol and Red Rocks 4-Wheelers in Moab, Utah. Most of my off-road trails are in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico or Arizona, with Moab Utah being my favorites. I volunteer each year with the RR4W at Easter Jeep Safari and you can probably catch up with me in the registration booth or on a trail.

It kept me busy for a year, and helped me learn many of the ins and outs of suspension work, and helped me learn that I should never again lay my hands on any kind of welder (you should have seen my custom fabbed rear bumper, horrible!) I bought it for $500, sold it 12 months later for about $3,500, and netted a $1,000 profit. I put this money towards the down payment on our first home (wifey promised we would get another Jeep when the time was right). My dad's lease came due on his '08 late november/early december of '10, and I made certain that Staci understood that the time was right...so we bought it out! Thanks to the YJ (and the help of JF and the knowledge of all of the members), it was pretty easy getting my hands dirty. Every bit of work was done by yours truly, with the occasional helping hand of a mechanic I have made good friends with in my service department (I'm a Buick GMC dealer). If it weren't for his tools and the use of a rack at work, I'd only be 1/4 of the way into my build as compared to where I am now. I am looking to join a group that goes for monthly outings (probably Ohio 4x4) so I can learn more about wheeling technique, and decide where I want my build to go from here - the trick is finding the free time to make it out regularly! Thanks to all of you that have provided insight, suggestions, and your knowledge on a subject that 2.5 years ago, I knew nothing about.

Got started fairly quickly with the mods and got the first phase done after about 1850 miles. I wheeled it on stock 4.10's and 35's for about 7k miles and then ponied up the $ for the PR44 w/ RCVs and 5.13's. I have zero regrets. This thing is beefy. Next phase is gonna be Poison Spyder flares, 38's, and Redneck Ram hydro assist. That'll have to wait until I return from Iraq in August.

I was 10 min earlier arrival than a guy who waited at a side table to buy the same JK. I took it. It's been 5+ years of building to create the ideal DD, trail running, rock crawling, camping JK; and it does it all very well.

Although I used to wheel a Ford F-250 decades ago, my wife got me hooked on Jeeping when she signed up our family for a Camp Jeep. We took the family ZJ (1996 Grand Cherokee Limited) to the event and were amazed what it could do stock except for the tires. Afterwards I bought skids for the ZJ and was ready to order rock rails when my wife reminded me that it was the family car. So, she bought me a 1998 TJ for Christmas. IN 2002 when the Rubicon was announced I knew I had to have one and placed an order with my local dealer. Mine was the first Rubicon delivered to the dealership. After building it and wheeling it for a few years I sold it and bought the 2009 in March 2009. It has been a work in progress ever since. I have wheeled it at Oak Ridge, Crozet and at Big Dogs events (all in VA), as well as at the beach. So far it has been unstoppable and I haven't broken anything! I have had a set of Raceline wheels on order for a couple of months...they tell me it will just be three more weeks. I am a member of Middle Peninsula Jeep Association, Inc.
