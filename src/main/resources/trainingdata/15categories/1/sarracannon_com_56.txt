Iâ€™m emerging from my writing cave where I am *almost* finished with Deep Dark Secrets to tell you about an exciting new series that is going to be launching this fall. The Willow Harbor Series is something Iâ€™ve been working on for the past seven or eight months with some of my very best writing friendsâ€“Alyssa Rose Ivy, Jennifer Snyder, and Juliana Haygert. You might remember the Midnight Kiss novella collection we worked on together several years ago. If youâ€™ve read my story, After Midnight, thatâ€™s where it originally came from. Well, over the years, weâ€™ve been talking and keeping in touch. Weâ€™ve talked several times about doing something else together, but it wasnâ€™t until the end of 2016 that we had the idea of writing a new adult paranormal small-town romance series where we each wrote our own stand-alone novels but where the town itself was the same and our characters interacted with each other. We spent the next several months coming up with a map of the town and lots of fun recurring characters and town elements that will make it fun to keep coming back to Willow Harbor. The four of us are so excited to tell you about the series and to release the first 4 titles. These four books will all release on the same day this fall for just 99 cents to make it easy for everyone to pick up all four books on release day and get immersed in the town of Willow Harbor with all its mysterious residents. I just know you guys are going to love it! And since Willow Harbor is a beach town, youâ€™re going to get a cool mix of supernatural creatures to read about, including some ocean-based races like mermaids and oceanids. Itâ€™s going to be awesome. Here are the first four books coming out! Shifterâ€™s Fate by Alyssa Rose Ivy Vampireâ€™s Descent by Jennifer Snyder Hunterâ€™s Revenge by Juliana Haygert Tritonâ€™s Curse by Sarra Cannon My book, Tritonâ€™s Curse, will be Book 4 in the series. Please go add this book and all of the others to your goodreads to-read list! Upcoming Releases I realize that many of you are wondering about Book 9 in the Shadow Demons Saga, and I canâ€™t explain to you how much your support after I wrote this post about my recent struggles meant to me. You guys gave me the encouragement I needed in order to write something brand new (Deep Dark Secrets), which has finally gotten me writing again! Iâ€™ll be announcing a release date for Deep Dark Secrets very soon (should be a July release!), and then Iâ€™ll be focused on finishing Beyond The Darkness, Shadow Demons Saga Book 9. Fingers crossed Iâ€™ll be able to release Book 9 in August or early September. Tritonâ€™s Curse will be out a little bit later this fall, along with the other three Willow Harbor books by Alyssa, Jennifer, and Juliana. That means a ton of books coming for you throughout the rest of the year. I hope you guys are as excited as I am that the writing is finally flowing again! Your support during my difficult times has meant more to me than I can possible express in words. Thank you with all of my heart! More news and official release dates and cover reveals coming very soon, but in the meantime, if you want to learn a little more about Willow Harbor, how the idea came to be, and what you can expect in the first four books of the series, please visit our brand new Willow Harbor website where Iâ€™ve posted a little bonus information on the series. Also, come join us in our Willow Harbor Facebook group where weâ€™ll be doing a few fun giveaways and bringing you more news about Willow Harbor as we get closer to release. Â See you there!

While re reading your other books I tried to find the Midnight Kiss novella collection on Amazon and Google play however, it will not let me buy it says currently not available in my country. Not sure why. Just wanted to pass on the feed back since it is not a new book I live in the US so not sure why it would say that. I have after midnight. Reply Sarra Cannon says June 26, 2017 at 2:38 pm Lupita, Thank you! Midnight Kiss was only available for a limited time as a set and then we each published our books separately. We are planning to republish the set for free soon, though, so keep an eye out for that! Reply Bella says June 26, 2017 at 1:25 pm Iâ€™m so excited for this series! Itâ€™s going to be so amazing. Reply Jessica says June 26, 2017 at 1:50 pm Yay excited for this series! Very very excited for the shadow demon saga book 9, Iâ€™ve reread the series probably 4-5 times because I love it so much! Reply Robyn Weitz says June 27, 2017 at 9:56 am I cannot wait to read this new series. Please put me on all and any list you have for updates. Thank you, Robyn W Reply Cherri-Anne Boitson says June 30, 2017 at 11:15 pm Hi Sarra! As like the others, I am super excited for this series! While I do have a LOT of your books (and quite a few of the other gals too!), I have been so busy reviewing, in fact ALL of my unlimited reading time is booked up with review books (and I wouldnâ€™t change that for anything! ðŸ™‚ ) But I do promise to keep on buying your books and that when I do read them, I will also review them! I am hoping that you will have a newsletter for this series specific so that I donâ€™t miss anything! ðŸ™‚ Reply Allison says July 6, 2017 at 9:25 pm Iâ€™m really excited for you, and for your devoted readers (like me)! I canâ€™t wait to get my hands on it! Thank you for the update! Hoping you are happy and healthy. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
