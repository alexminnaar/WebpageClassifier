Nov. 26 2016 #shopsmall #small business #unified queens #queens #queens new york #astoria #ridgewood #ridgewood market #monorail #worlds fair We’re so excited to debut our new shirt! The area of today’s Ridgewood has been a border town since the 16th Century. The Kings/Queens line has been redrawn many times, with the neighborhood moving back and forth between the boroughs. In 1979, after successfully petitioning the city, Ridgewood was finally granted a Queens postal code. This shirt pays homage to that year, as well as the Ridgewood Grove Boxing Arena, which from 1926 to 1956 hosted bouts between future champs and Golden Gloves contenders. Limited first run of 100 shirts. Order yours today!

Does the design respect the historical aspect we are trying to portray? Can we add in some not-so-obvious symbols and Easter eggs for people who really know their Queens history? For our I Rode the Monorail shirt, we used a font similar to the one used in a lot of World’s Fair programs. For the Astoria Diving Club we made sure to add Hell Gate Bridge in the background and accurately depict the diving board. For our Queen of Unispheres design, we took things up a notch. Using a Queens borough flag from 1913 as inspiration, we put many elements from it into the design - including the crown, tulip, rose, color pattern and more. Here’s the flag: Background from the Queens Gazette: The blue and white stripes represent Dutch Governor William Kieft’s shield. Kieft bought Queens County from the Indians on Nov. 1, 1683. It included present day Queens County, Nassau County and part of Western Suffolk County. The circle of wampum (white shell beads) symbolize the Indian name for Long Island, Seawanhaka. The tulip represents the Dutch, who first settled in Queens and the rose represents the House of York and Lancaster. The Queens crown, in the upper lefthand corner, symbolizes the name of the county and borough, honoring Queen Catherine of Braganza. The date below it is the date that Queens became a part of the city, Jan. 1, 1898. As for the unisphere, well… what can we say, we just love unispheres! Order your shirt today!

When I first stumbled upon SUDA, I was floored. The quality of their designs, photography, attention to detail, and overall aesthetic is a serious inspiration. It makes me want to make Unified Queens better. On top of that, David Orellana, founder and designer of SUDA, is a great human, offering advice and help to us and being a positive role model in the community. He answered our questions below. When did you open your shop? SUDA started back in 2012. This October will be 4 years we’ve been around. It’s amazing how much gets done in that time period.  Read More...
