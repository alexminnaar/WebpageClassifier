Essendon are one A grade inside mid and a couple solid B grade mids (Think Dom Tyson level) from challenging for a flag. Probably need a medium forward too but I really rate their list.   schmuttt, Aug 20, 2017 at 1:46 AM #3 Reply WWSD, Stevi_Tigers, Aeglos and 5 others like this. BOMBERS 4 LIFE!!!!

Forward line is great and the back line is solid just need to fix our mid field which won't be difficult to fix.   BOMBERS 4 LIFE!!!!, Aug 20, 2017 at 1:55 AM #4 Reply schmuttt Premium Platinum Melbourne Other teams: West Ham United Joined: Apr 14 Posts: 12,531 Location: Sunshine BOMBERS 4 LIFE!!!! said: ↑ Yep agree.

Francis could be that medium forward option if he ever gets on the park though.   schmuttt, Aug 20, 2017 at 2:00 AM #5 Reply demondavey likes this.

There is nothing unprecedented about our 2017 year other than all the off-field stuff which happened over the last few years. If I was rating our team I'd say: great forward line, above (slightly) average defense and poor midfield pretty much sums us up. Teams with poor midfields don't tend to do too well in finals - its pretty obvious to all that we are light on for quality inside ball winners. If we managed to win a finals game that would be a successful year in my book, even making the finals is probably a par result. Won't get further than round 2 of finals.   blitzer, Aug 20, 2017 at 2:34 AM #8 Reply Mootsy, VictorianCrow85, Ari and 1 other person like this.

Players like Watson, Stanton, Howlett, Goddard, Myers, Baguley, Kelly etc aren't essential to our team going forward. It's our core of youth that leads the way for us.   JayJ20, Aug 20, 2017 at 5:12 AM #10 Reply JT_the_Man, Aramis, Bomber_Dan and 4 others like this.

We're we the older team in all 10 losses? Genuinely interesting stat. Older by much or the sort of thing that switching 32yo Watson for 20yo Langford would make all the difference?   carnthedons, Aug 20, 2017 at 8:15 AM #13 Reply Capt Hindsight Club Legend Essendon Other teams: Joined: Sep 16 Posts: 1,278 Maybe be locked into finals before making this thread.   Capt Hindsight, Aug 20, 2017 at 8:36 AM #14 Reply Milanista28 and chogby like this.

StillAtLarge Club Legend Hawthorn Other teams: Joined: May 15 Posts: 2,363 Not a bad list and probably the most entertaining side to watch this season but their game plan is a bit iffy. When the oppo have momentum the bombers concede far too many goals, they just can't grind out portions of a game when they're up against it. If they're fair dinkum about doing something in september they should give jobe a lap of honour this week   StillAtLarge, Aug 20, 2017 at 8:45 AM #17 Reply JT_the_Man, Jackie_Chiles, VictorianCrow85 and 3 others like this.

We've had our injuries, but not too bad this year. Yeah the easy fixture is not the reason that we're in the 8. We stuffed it up against Brisbane and Carlton which took any advantage away from us. Besides, our double ups are pretty similar. Essendon: Adelaide Collingwood Fremantle Carlton Brisbane Melbourne: Adelaide Collingwood St Kilda Carlton North Melbourne Both of us have two bottom 4 sides, 2 teams between 11-14 and the likely minor premiers   JayJ20, Aug 20, 2017 at 10:28 AM #24 Reply 00Stinger Duel Group 1 winner Melbourne Other teams: Liverpool & San Francisco 49ers Joined: May 07 Posts: 11,909 Location: @ HOME JayJ20 said: ↑ We've had our injuries, but not too bad this year.

Yep our fixture hasn't turned out to be as hard as it looked pre-season. We have been slaughtered with injuries though and suspensions haven't helped either Essendon have had a dream run with injuries this year. Probably deserve some luck after the last few seasons though to be fair   00Stinger, Aug 20, 2017 at 10:33 AM #25 Reply (You must log in or sign up to reply here.)
