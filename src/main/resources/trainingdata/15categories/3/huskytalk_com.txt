Customized Motorcycle Insurance. Coverage For Different Types Of Bikes. 2040 Petrol & Diesel Ban in UK Jul 26, 2017 - 11:38 AM - by zulujams I hope this is the right forum area for posting this. I came across an interesting article for the UK's plan to improve air quality. See the link below. While most of it affects cars and trucks (which would affect residents not on two wheels and maybe your source of beer and other goodies), there was a mention for motorcycles too. I've pasted the motorcycle section below for those who want to get right to it. http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40726868 Quote: Will motorcyclists be affected?

Isnt it hard work that usually involves at least one bleeding knuckle? Dont the tools cost a small fortune when you consider that shops only charge about 25 bucks for the service? Well, some riders dont live within a few miles of a bike shop. And some folks, well, theyve always got to do things themselves. The good news is that, overworked sweat glands aside, changing ...

But no man is an island, and group rides are their own special kind of fun. At MO, we definitely do our fair share of group rides.
