While a good number of folks clearly stayed home, about two-thirds of the ticket holders showed up and took their spots on the Botanic Gardens lawn for a night with the incomparable songwriter Randy Newman. After being shuttled to the stage in a golf cart, Newman started his set shortly after 6:30 as fans tried to keep their cheese and crackers out of the incessant rain which didn’t let up until the musician said “good-night.” Guns N’ Roses – August 2nd – Sports Authority Field at Mile High Wednesday night at Mile High there was an interesting mix of long term G N’ R fans, middle aged music fans and suburbanites dressed for a night on the town. Watching these guys, who once defined American 80’s rock and roll excess, it is hard to imagine they’re in their 50’s. While they may not still be writing anthems like Paradise City or Welcome To The Jungle, they sure can perform them and delight their fans with a true rock and roll show. Zac Brown Band – July 29th – Coors Field Saturday night, for only the second time in Coors Field’s history, a major concert rolled in, filling some forty thousand seats in the open air of downtown Denver. The massive stage sat in the center of the outfield, and fans blanketed the field, minus the precious infield. Even to a casual fan, the scale and setting alone was exciting. It had all the grandeur of a show at the Pepsi Center with the charm and comfort of a warm summer night in the open air. Zac Brown Band proceeded to rip through a long evening deep with covers and original hits. The Wheels of Soul: Tedeschi Trucks Band, The Wood Brothers, Hot Tuna – July 30th – Red Rocks Amphitheatre The Wheels of Soul rolled into Red Rocks last weekend and featured two nights of Tedeschi Trucks Band, The Wood Brothers, and Hot Tuna. Despite some rain early on Sunday, the fans got a healthy helping of Roots, Soul, Rock and Blues that featured more collaborations and covers than anyone could have anticipated. It was a memorable night on The Rocks and one that will likely go down in the lore of the storied venue.

Michael Franti & Spearhead – July 13th – Red Rocks Amphitheater Posted on July 20, 2017 | No Comments The skies cleared last Thursday as they always seem to when Michael Franti & Spearhead comes to town. Dozens of yogis made their way to Red Rocks early to practice some pre-concert yoga with live music by Michael Franti and Vinyasa teachings by Gina Caputo. After the hour-long class, music lovers made their march up the rocks to kick the night off with HIRIE. HIRIE was followed by Trevor Hall and finally Franti himself. From start to finish, his energy was high and he continued to find ways to delight even the most jaded in attendance. Continue Reading...
