It was available in the USA from 1990-94 and in Canada until 1995, in the G60 and SLC models, all in 3 door (hatchback) form. In Europe it was sold from 1988-95 and was also available in a non-supercharged 2L 8v or 16v 4cyl model, as well as 2.9L VR6 model. Roughly 19,000 Corrados were imported into North America making it a fairly rare sports car. All Corrados were assembled at the Karmann plant in Osnabruck, Germany. The G60 model has a supercharged 1.8L 8v 4cyl engine (PG block) delivering about 160hp to the front wheels in stock form. It was available from 1990-92 and the G60 name comes from the G-lader type supercharger with a scroll width of 60mm. The later SLC models housed a normally aspirated 2.8L V6 engine known as the VR6, with about 180hp stock. The SLC also had small modifications to the suspension and a more luxurious trim level with options such as a leather interior. The general consensus is that the VR6 model is faster in a straight line but the G60 handles better due to the lower weight, although model preference is always a matter of subjective preference. The Corrado is a parts-bin engineering special, with many of its parts sourced from other VW models such as the Golf and Jetta. Other parts such as body panels, headlights and door handles are unique to the Corrado. Like any forced induction car, the G60 tends to wear out on these cars, especially if abused, but they are usually rebuildable for not a lot of cash. There are a few well known design defects, like broken door handles, sunroof cables, and heater cores, but in general the cars are very reliable if maintained properly. However since these are fairly quick, sporty cars many have been abused and a new owner should be very careful to check over any prospective purchase thoroughly.
