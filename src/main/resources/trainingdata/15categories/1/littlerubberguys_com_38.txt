All in all, I think forums like this and T are sorta falling to the wayside of popular social media. Only time will tell which will prevail.   There are rumors and speculation as to why things have died off at OT. I don't think anyone outside of George and Ayleen know for sure.   IMO, Series 4 was not supported well at all. Were there even any colorways? Artist proofs? Outside of the KS and slime green Brainwaves? A real shame because I love everything about Series 4. I almost even bought my own Kaiju Kaos-exclusive colorway but the timing fell poorly with my wife's poor health. 2 Check out my mini figures, miniatures and toys.

Five artists get a toy produced and 200 free figures thanks to a community vote, and only one has made their pink figures available for sale as far as I know. 1 Back to top #9 PlasticSoul PlasticSoul LRG Elite LRG Council 2819 posts Gender:Male Location:USA Posted 19 June 2016 - 08:47 PM This bothered me about series 4. Five artists get a toy produced and 200 free figures thanks to a community vote, and only one has made their pink figures available for sale as far as I know.   Yeah that was a bit rough.   I used to collect the artist versions pretty much exclusively because I like pink toys and I like supporting the artists themselves but once I had no chance at getting them anymore I gave up on the line. 1 Back to top #10 redjarojam redjarojam Taco Beast Members 920 posts Gender:Male Posted 20 June 2016 - 08:42 AM 0 Instagram Tumblr Flickr Back to top #11 bigazzhead bigazzhead Toy Addict Members 1445 posts Gender:Male Location:Chicago Interests:Mini Figure interests: Monster in my Pocket Megaman/Rockman Dragon Ball Dragon Quest Old Nintendo Gegege no Kitaro general monster keshi Ghostbusters Zombie related stuff and anything cool.

There is no way to say thank you enough to the people that have become family to us and to each and every fan who has supported our projects over the years...       So does this spell the end for the OMFG line!?  Will series 5 never get out of the design stage!?   Brought to my attention by Keshi Drop http://spiderearthbl...lls-it-day.html Edited by rootstudio, 28 January 2017 - 11:56 AM. 0   Back to top #17 bronchuseven bronchuseven pentagonal Members 755 posts Gender:Male Location:Austin TX Posted 30 January 2017 - 03:11 PM Well that sucks… I was planning on making another order once the store came back online from holiday hiatus - I wonder if they'll unload the remaining stock at some point. 0 Back to top #18 typicalstereo typicalstereo Half Ironman/Half Sausage Members 124 posts Gender:Male Location:Georgia Interests:One Piece minifigures/keshi.

The 8 colors seen are the only full releases I have done to date. Red is the latest color added to the palette. I plan to do blue but it likely won't be until 2018. I need to retire a bunch of other colors first. 1 Check out my mini figures, miniatures and toys.
