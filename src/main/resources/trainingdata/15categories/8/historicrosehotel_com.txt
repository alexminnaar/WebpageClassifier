The Rose Hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The Rose Hotel is owned by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency and underwent a major renovation at a cost of $1.6m. The Rose Hotel is a two story "L" shaped brick structure. Portions were constructed in phases (circa 1830) & (circa 1848), & following the civil war. A striking veranda overlooking the Ohio River was added around 1866. The building has been "restored" and is used today as a "Hotel & Bed & Breakfast" facility.
