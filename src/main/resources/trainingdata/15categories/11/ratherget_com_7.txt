Emails sent to RatherGet for purposes other than communication about copyright infringement may not be answered. RatherGet has a policy of terminating repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.

Disclaimers Ratherget may participate in advertising programs. These programs may include BestBuy Affiliates, TripAdvisor Affiliates, Amazon Associates, and other similar programs. This participation does not affect the unbiased nature of RatherGet's service. Ratherget rankings are still 100% unbiased, and Ratherget never alters product rankings to increase profit. RatherGet is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com. Integration, Amendment, and Severability Please note that this Terms of Service constitutes the entire legal agreement between you and RatherGet and governs your use of the RatherGet Services (but excluding any services, if any, that RatherGet may provide to you under a separate written agreement). It may not be amended or varied by you except in a writing signed by RatherGet. Although we understand that electronic or digital signatures are frequently viewed as the equivalent of traditional written signatures these days, for these purposes a signature may not include an electronic or digital signature. Even if RatherGet acts in a way that appears to you to be inconsistent with these Terms of Service, such action(s) should not be deemed a waiver or constructive amendment of these Terms. This Terms of Service operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
