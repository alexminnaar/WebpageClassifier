Any Gelatoni, Shellie May or Duffy item (prices vary) I hated Duffy for a very long time. I was a purist. How could they just plop this bear in the middle of World Showcase with some gussied-up back story and expect us to buy it? I think my partner was messing with me when she bought me my first Duffy – that’s right … my first Duffy. But the little guy has won me over. Gelatoni is Tokyo Disney-exclusive and Shellie May is at both the Tokyo Disney Resort and Aulani. (You know, Aulani … Disney’s resort for people who can’t just appreciate the fact that they are in freaking Hawaii.) Read More...

But not until Wednesday did the Dark Knight find himself investigating a black teenager in a hoodie shot dead by a frightened white police officer, let alone wondering about his own indirect role in the boy’s death. The latest issue of DC Comics’ flagship Batman series throws itself headfirst into the agonizing conversations roiling America more than a year after Ferguson officer Darren Wilson killed 18-year old Michael Brown. The globally iconic superhero confronts racialized police brutality and its intersection with urban poverty and gentrification – problems Batman comes to realize he exacerbates in his secret identity as billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne. Comics critics say they are hard pressed to remember Batman ever addressing institutional racism and its socio-economic dimensions as bluntly as this in the character’s 75-year history. While police corruption has long been a feature of Gotham – even showing up on the eponymous Fox TV adaptation about to enter its second season – it it is rarely shown to disproportionately impact black people. Yet Batman #44, a flashback story, begins with the blunt image of a dead black boy, his body left “for the crows”, as the narration reads, resonant of Michael Brown in Ferguson. He wears a hooded sweatshirt, as did Trayvon Martin before George Zimmerman killed the 17-year old. What begins as A Simple Case – the title of the issue – becomes a meditation on the meaning of a rich, white vigilante who attempts to solve intractable urban problems by beating up bad guys.

Publishing Mickey comic book stories in the United States was pioneered by the third Mickey Mouse Magazine series (1935–1940). Initially published by Hal Horne, it had artwork by John Stanley and text pieces by Irving Brecher. By mid-1936, Horne turned over the magazine to Kay Kamen who oversaw merchandising for Disney. Kamen the following year recruited Western Publishing to handle production and publication. Western added reprinted Disney comic strips to the book's lineup beginning with the July 1937 issue; these included Gottfredson's Mickey daily strips re-formatted and colored for serialized magazine publication. In the words of historian Michael Barrier "Reprinted newspaper comics were never more than a minor part of its lineup until the very last issue, dated September 1940, when they suddenly took up half the pages." But Barrier has also judged the strip reprints "stood out by virtue of their crisp professionalism". The successor title, Walt Disney's Comics and Stories (WDC&S), described by Barrier as a true comic book, began publication with the Oct. 1940 issue and had the Gottfredson serials as a prominent feature. 1937 Mickey Mouse Magazine Vol 3 2 Halloween Disney Comic Noma Light Ad $32.00 Mickey Mouse and the Bat Bandit Big Little Book 1935 $17.00 Mickey Mouse and His Friends 1936 904 Linen Like Walt Disney USA book Vintage $30.00 Mickey Mouse 1409 INC Whitman 1937 Big Little Book Disney BLB c12353 $8.00 Mickey Mouse and Goofy Explore Energy Conservation Comic Book1 of 3 1978Disney $9.99 Mickey Mouse and the Bat Badit 1153 G+ Whitman 1935 Big Little Book c12350 $26.40 Read More...

It was minted to raise funds for the World's Columbian Exposition, held in 1893, and to mark the quadricentennial of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the Americas—it bears a portrait of him. The Columbian half dollar was the first United States commemorative coin, and the first American coin to picture a historical person. The coin stems from the desire of organizers of the Columbian Exposition to gain federal money to complete construction of the fair. Congress granted an appropriation, and allowed it to be in the form of commemorative half dollars, which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium. Fair official James Ellsworth wanted the new coin to be based on a 16th century painting he owned by Lorenzo Lotto, reputedly of Columbus, and pushed for this through the design process. When initial sketches by Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber proved unsatisfactory, fair organizers turned to a design by artist Olin Levi Warner, which after modification by Barber and by his assistant, George T. Morgan, was struck by the Mint. 1893 Columbian Commemorative Half Dollar NGC AU Details $15.00 1893 Columbian Commemorative Half Dollar NGC AU Details $15.00 1892 Columbian Half Dollar with Great Details in a PCGS Holder A Must See $30.00 1893 Columbian Exposition Commemorative Half Dollar NGC No Reserve $4.69 (6 Bids) 1893 50c Columbian Exposition Commemorative Half Dollar PCGS MS63 $40.00 (1 Bid) 1892 Columbian Exposition Commemorative Half Dollar PCGS MS64 Toned $20.50 (3 Bids) Read More...

Dice from favored Mob run casinos such as the Flamingo casino in Las Vegas also bring higher prices. Unfortunately, older dice made with cellulose nitrate eventually begin to crystallize. The most valuable dice from the Flamingo are those where the crystallization has yet to happen. These dice have a flamingo on them and are from 1947, before "Bugsy" Siegal was killed in his Beverly Hills mansion. Collectors tend to like dice from clubs they have heard of, so a pair from the Desert Inn in Las Vegas that had six crap games might sell for $100 while a pair from the Sonoma Inn in Winnemucca that only had one crap game might sell for only $50, even though they are much rarer.

Christopher's toys also lent their names to most of the other characters, except for Owl, Rabbit, and Gopher (added in the Disney version). Christopher Robin's toy bear is now on display at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library in New York City. Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie, a Canadian black bear which he often saw at London Zoo, and "Pooh", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario, Canada, while en route to England during the First World War. He named the bear "Winnie" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba. "Winnie" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much loved attraction there. Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young.

Browning & Co., of Toledo, Ohio and London, Ontario. It’s in fair to good condition and comparable examples often sell at auction in the $ 80-$ 150 range. Next in this series of “Unloved Antiques” is the American “Old Family Bible.” Most families have one, often said to be “At least 200 years old,” inherited from some distant deceased relative and nearly always with a fantastic tale relating to the Frontier, Old West or the Civil War. To date we have must have examined dozens of bibles that were said to have belonged to family members related to Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant and even Abe Lincoln*. Sadly, none of them had any provenance, and nearly all were printed long after all of these notables had gone to their final reward. Most of these bibles we receive appraisal requests for are actually very late 19th-century presentation pieces, highly ornate bibles with embossed covers, in some cases with latches that resemble something one would find in a 14th-century monastery. Quite often, these were given as gifts to newlyweds or newly ordained priests and ministers by family or friends, eventually handed down from one generation to the next. Some are inscribed with dedications, dates and names to give some hint as to their original ownership, but after two or three generations, the inscribed date is dismissed as “written in years later,” particularly if the last name inscribed is similar to someone famous—like Ulysses S. Grant—or infamous such—as Jesse James or William Bonnie (Billy the Kid). Upon examination of the first few pages, most of these bibles will reveal the publishing date and the name and location of the publisher; most, like the example above, tend to post date the 1870s and were made right through the turn of the 20th century. Values for these late 19th-century American Bibles can be upwards of $ 400 at auction, if in very good shape and printed by a well-respected publisher. But most we see suffer from 100-plus-years of being shoved into bookcases, drawers and hope chests. The example above dates to 1877, published by the O.A. Browning & Co., of Toledo, Ohio and London, Ontario. It’s in fair to good condition¹, and comparable examples often sell at auction in the $ 80-$ 150 range. ——————————— *With such pieces, with genuine provenance to someone like the Western outlaw Jesse James, Mother can take the value of a battered, run-of-the-mill 19th-century bible from $ 80 to more than $ 3,000 at auction. If you have any doubt at all about the value and origins of an old book, we strongly suggest having it examined and appraised by an antiquarian book dealer. ——————————— ¹ “Fair” describes a worn book that has complete text pages, including maps or plates, but may be missing end papers. The binding will generally be worn in spot and any defects will be noted in the description. “Good” describes an average used and worn book that still has all pages or leaves. Any defects will be noted in the description. ——————————— Previous “Unloved Antiques” articles: • Unloved Antiques: ‘Limited Edition’ Collectors Plates • Unloved Antiques: Singer Sewing Machines • Unloved Antiques: Decorator Prints • Unloved Antiques: Commemorative Whiskey Decanters • Unloved Antiques: ‘Bronze’ Flatware • Unloved Antiques: 1847 Rogers Brothers Flatware • Unloved Antiques: Hummel Knockoffs • Unloved Antiques: National Geographic Magazines • Unloved Antiques: Dragonware • Unloved Antiques: 19th Century Religious Prints • Unloved Antiques: Depression Glass • Unloved Antiques: Stradivarius-Style Violins • Unloved Antiques: 19th-Century Pump Organs • Unloved Antiques: ‘Starving Artist’ Painting Mike Wilcox, of Wilcox & Hall Appraisers, is a Worthologist who specializes in Art Nouveau and the Arts and Craft movement. ———————————   WorthPoint Brought to you by PriceMiner and Worthpoint Vintage Holy Bible Oxford Press Authorised King James Version RED LETTER $9.99 Vintage Holy Bible King James Version Holman Red Letter Zipper with Cross Pull $19.99 Vintage Holy Bible KJV Self pronouncing Thomas Nelson Sons 1943 $7.99 Vintage 1886 Holy Bible The Original Tongues Centennial Edition with Color Maps $24.99 Vintage NOS Heirloom Holy Bible Master Reference Edition SEALED $14.95 1859 Holy Bible Old and New Testament American Pocket Antique Vintage $25.00 Read More...
