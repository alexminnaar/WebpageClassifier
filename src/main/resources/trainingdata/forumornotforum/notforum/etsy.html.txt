(12,944) reviews Shipping & Policies MRC Wood Products' personalized mason jar mugs make a wonderful gift for anyone. When you give these monogramed mason jar mugs, whether it be for newlyweds, bridal parties, anniversaries, or just because, the response will be fantastic. Each mug holds 16 ounces and measures 5 inches tall x 3 inches in diameter. The mugs will be engraved by sandblasting the image. Sandblasting provides a much deeper and richer engraving than laser etching. SOLD INDIVIDUALLY This design incorporates the first and last names of the couple and included the year the couple or family was established.

Orders placed in December may experience longer processing times than other times throughout the year. We are currently processing extremely high order volumes and will be taking a few days off around the holidays to spend with family and friends. Order times may be as much as 3 weeks from date of the order. Thank you for your understanding and patience during this busy time of year for all of us! We work hard at MRC to make sure we ship custom orders as quickly as possible. A majority of our items are shipped within 3-5 business days, but some items can take 8-10 days to complete. This depends on the complexity of the product, current order volume, and the processes required to make the item. Can I see a proof of my order? Yes! We are able to provide a proof of your design. We do ask that you first place the order and request a proof when leaving the instructions for the item. You may make 2 changes to your complimentary proof. Additional changes will incur a small fee to cover the time required on your project. I accidentally gave you wrong information for my order. Don't feel too bad. This happens WAY more than you might think. It is easy to rush through the order process and give inaccurate information. Unfortunately, we are unable to "fix" items that are engraved or printed with incorrect information. In these cases, we are able to offer you 50% off of a replacement item if you would like to correct the mistake. Please contact us to receive an active coupon code to receive the discount. I gave you the wrong shipping address. What do I do now? Believe it or not, we hear this question 4-5 times per day. Depending on the service that was used to ship your package, we MAY be able to re-route the package for you. There will be a fee charged to you in order to do this (fee is charged by the carrier, not MRC). If you package is delivered to the address, we can attempt to contact the person at that address and have it forwarded. Sometimes the package is returned to us and we can then work out arrangements with you to have the package sent back out to the correct address. You will be responsible for return shipping to MRC and for the postage to send the item back out to you.
