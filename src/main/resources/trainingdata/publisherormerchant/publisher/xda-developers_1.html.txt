A higher rating indicates that photos offer rich color (without over-saturating), sharp detail (with all subjects in-focus), and appropriate exposure (with even lighting). Then, drop a comment if you have anything to add!

Sometimes the LG camera gets the white point a little off. For example, if you're in a restaurant with a lot of red lamps, it may read as a warmer setting. This is something that can be adjusted manually (and easily fixed in an image editor) I feel like some of the details are "smoothed" out, but I don't know if that has to do with the camera as much as the app. It's not necessarily bad. If you take micro shots, it's more noticeable, this smoothing effect. It may be a setting in the camera... if you want crisp shots, it's certainly feasible. For example, I was taking up close shots of the fabric of the clothes I am wearing. However, sometimes it is hard to get the camera app to focus on the right thing. It's worse the closer you are to the subject. However it can definitely focus up-close with the non-wide angle camera, though I think a bit less than my Samsung S5 used to be able to do. If you need textures for graphic design work, it's definitely feasible though.

You can tell when you zoom in.

Click on photo and zoom in a bit you'll install see what I'm talking about. I love wide angle for closer you shots though. 2nd photo of fire is really just to show why u love the manual settings.

Using a camera app other than LG's own stock camera app will most likely result in poorer quality images. LG specifically optimizes their app to take advantage of the phone's hardware to the fullest potential. Thus why if you ever flash a non-stock-based ROM, you will find that your camera is just not as good as before.

The manual option gets easier when you figure out how to use it.. You'll be able to get some great pics with it.
