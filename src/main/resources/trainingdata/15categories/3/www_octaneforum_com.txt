Victory Octane Ride Review: Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Go-Fast 10 334,775 by NickJ : Mar 18, 2016 at 2:39 PM ​ This last week I got to spend some quality time with the Octane in Daytona, FL during Bike Week. I took the opportunity to take two variations of the bike out to see just how much the accessories change the attitude and stance of the bike. Unfortunately, I missed the press event due to the motorcycle build I had been working on for the several weeks. I hear that it was a smashing good time, complete with lessons from the Victory Stunt Team, Tony and Joe. I did, however get to roll out of the super secret hangar with a couple of Octanes for some testing of my own. I started out with the standard model with no adds to establish the baseline. Now, I don't know if many of you have ridden along the arrow-like roads down in Florida, but there are not many curves in the state. Essentially you go north, northwest from Miami, there is a left at Jacksonville and then it's pretty much a straight shot west to Mobile. However, the best road in Daytona was the demo route that offered some sweeping, banked turns, with both left AND right-handers. I know right?! With the standard pullback bars, I was in a comfortable, neutral position. I'm 5'10" and the cockpit of... Continue... Hands on with the Victory Octane: An Inside View 4 1,693 by NickJ : Feb 19, 2016 at 11:06 AM The Victory Octane has been on your lips for months. The long lead-up to Feb 19th is finally over. The Victory Octane details are official. The Octane shares the Indian Scout's basic setup and proportions, featuring a liquid-cooled 1179.3cc motor and a fully integrated radiator, however this machine is born to make power, not evoke nostalgia. The power plant pumps out 104 horsepower and 76 pound-feet of torque. It will get a quarter of a mile down the road in 12 seconds and read 60 mph on the speedo in under 4. We got a chance to hang out with the boys at Victory for some testing and shooting. I rode the bike on track and let me tell you, this thing can rip. I own a Scout and this bike felt a touch more nimble than the already-agile Scout. This is likely due to the tweaked suspension geometry and the 29.0 degrees of rake and 5.1 inches of trail. The rear shock sits more upright than the laid down attitude of the Scout....

What’s left is just what you need to go very fast, and nothing else. The all-new 2017 Victory Octane is the two-wheeled expression of that concept, with a modern twist. This is raw adrenaline that rules the streets. A 1200cc, liquid-cooled V-twin—Victory’s first-ever liquid-cooled engine—utilizes dual overhead cams and four-valve heads to rev beyond 8000 rpm and put down an authoritative 104 horsepower. That’s more horsepower than any Victory motorcycle ever built. And weighing just 528 pounds, it’s the lightest Victory motorcycle ever built, too. No surprise, then, that Octane is also the quickest Victory down the quarter-mile, and the fastest from 0-60 mph, too. And with a price starting at just $10,499, Octane runs in a class of its own. A stiff and light cast-aluminum frame transmits every last one of those horsepower directly to the pavement. Sharp steering geometry, a tight, 62.1-inch wheelbase and 32-degrees of available lean angle deliver agility... Continue... The 2017 Victory Octane is HERE! 1 1,858 by 4Nines : Feb 19, 2016 at 8:20 AM ​ OCTANE “We wanted to bring the American motorcycle into the 21st century. Victory doesn’t have any long history or legacy —we are a new brand and we can go wherever we want to go. We want to be modern, and bold, and set our own trends.” — Mike Song, Victory Senior Industrial Designer IGNITION “This is a real performance engine, with four-valve heads, overhead cams and a lot of torque. And the engine revs much higher, like a sportbike.” —Urs Erbacher PROJECT 156 “This bike is unapologetic. It’s not trying to be anything besides what it is—a strippedto-the-bone roadrace bike. You just go out and ride it.” —Roland Sands COMBUSTION “It’s not like any other American V-twin I’ve ever heard. It sounds like a Pro Stock motorcycle. It sounds pissed off. It sounds mean.” —Zack Ness ​ Power To Burn Liquid-cooled with 4-valve heads and dual-overhead cams, Octane’s 60-degree V-twin makes more horsepower than any Victory ever built—104 horsepower and 76 foot-pounds of tire-shredding torque. Geared for quick acceleration, Octane sprints down the... Continue... Thoughts from the Senior Engineer on the Octane 3 1,325 by 4Nines : Feb 11, 2016 at 10:19 AM ​“You’re just scared standing next to this thing,” says Senior Engineer of Powertrain Design, Alex Hopperman. Race bred and American built. #VictoryOctane #ModernAmericanMuscle The lead-up to the debut of the Octane is steadily marching on. This time the Powertrain Design engineer offers a few moments of his thoughts on the Octane. Sounds like this bike is going to have some big expectations to live up to. Continue...
