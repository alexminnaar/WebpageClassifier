I'm emerging from my writing cave where I am *almost* finished with Deep Dark Secrets to tell you about an exciting new series that is going to be launching this fall. The Willow Harbor Series is something I've been working on for the past seven or eight months with some of my very best writing friends--Alyssa Rose Ivy, Jennifer Snyder, and Juliana Haygert. You might remember the Midnight Kiss novella collection we worked on together several years ago. If you've read my story, … [Read more...] about Exciting Announcement: The Willow Harbor Series Filed Under: The Sweetie Chronicles Tagged With: Beyond the Darkness, Deep Dark Secrets, Shadow Demons Saga, Willow Harbor Dear Readers: An Honest Update From Sarra April 6, 2017 By Sarra Cannon 61 Comments My Dearest Readers, I’m here. I know I haven’t been around much on social media for the past month, but I wanted to let you all know that I’m still here. I’m still writing. I’m still doing my best. I’ve been thinking a lot over the past few days about what I wanted to say to you all when I came back after a much-needed break from most of my social media, and I found out that it’s really complicated. I have some pretty heavy things going on in my life, but they are also intensely personal. … [Read more...] about Dear Readers: An Honest Update From Sarra Filed Under: The Sweetie Chronicles Tagged With: Indie Authors, Project Update, The Indie Journey A Quick Demons Update February 28, 2017 By Sarra Cannon 22 Comments Hey, everyone! I know the big question on everyone's mind when it comes to my books is "When is the next Shadow Demons Saga book coming out?". Believe me, I completely understand how difficult it can be to wait for a book that you're dying to read, and I'm so incredibly grateful that you guys are excited about Beyond The Darkness. I had hoped to have a release date ready for you by the end of this month, but here we are on the last day of February, and I'm sad to say that I'm not ready to … [Read more...] about A Quick Demons Update Filed Under: The Sweetie Chronicles Tagged With: Beyond the Darkness, Shadow Demons Saga New Release!!! The Trouble With I Do, Fairhope 6 December 5, 2016 By Sarra Cannon Leave a Comment The final book in my Fairhope series, The Trouble With I Do, is out today! Gosh, you guys, this book was such a labor of love. It is probably the most vulnerable I have been in a book since The Trouble with Goodbye, and I think it's because Leigh Anne is so much like me in so many ways. The book is pure fiction, of course, but I guess there's a piece of me in every major heroine I write. Maybe Leigh Anne a little bit extra :). The Trouble With I Do comes full circle, returning us to the first … [Read more...] about New Release!!! The Trouble With I Do, Fairhope 6 Filed Under: The Sweetie Chronicles Tagged With: Fairhope, New Adult Contemporary Romance, The Trouble With I Do Celebrating 6 Years of Indie Publishing October 29, 2016 By Sarra Cannon 20 Comments   Happy Book Birthday to Beautiful Demons!!!! It was exactly six years ago today that my very first novel was published. I was excited and so in love with Harper and the story I had created, but I had no idea that Beautiful Demons would resonate with so many people! My first full month, I sold something like 59 copies of that first book, and I was on cloud nine! Someone was reading my book!! Of course, I knew back then that it was mostly friends and family, but I didn't care. I had done … [Read more...] about Celebrating 6 Years of Indie Publishing Filed Under: Indie Writer Resources, The Sweetie Chronicles Tagged With: Beautiful Demons, Giveaways, Indieversary Tracking NaNo WriMo Word Count in My Bullet Journal October 27, 2016 By Sarra Cannon 2 Comments It's almost that most magical time of year -- NaNo WriMo!!!
