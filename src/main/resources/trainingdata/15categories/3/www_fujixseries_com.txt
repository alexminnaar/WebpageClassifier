These are my first shots with a Voightlander 75mm f1.8 Heliar. I got it yesterday, and went out to try it out. I found using a manual lens a real joy, and manual focusing a lot easier than I had feared.

Standard setting for front wheel is ISO change, then push the wheel in and release for shutter speed change, push again for ISO. Using the shutter speed setting this the user can choose from in between shutter speeds rather than just full or 1/2 stops. I rarely shoot shutter priority but it can be handy to have full control over ISO settings without taking the camera down from shooting position. As a long time photographer I find there is too much automation and ways of overriding and setting parameters of same - even worse with so many different configurations of dials/buttons/switches with various restrictions on what can be used with what. I prefer to use manual or the simpler auto settings. Apologies, I genuinely thought that in one of the updates after the XA/XM cameras were released with their matching lenses without aperture rings, configuration was added to include body control with any lens.

Report · merlin Posted 4 hours ago Sunday Morning Flowers X-T2, 90mm f/2 Sunflowers Other Yellows Russian Sage Verbesina encelioides Buddleia Report · artuk Posted 7 hours ago Dear Susan: Unsplash - death to sales? I've had an article published on the "Dear Susan" website, where I give my reaction to the "Unsplash" website, which allows members to give away royalty free high resolution photographs. It includes a number of my physique sports competition photographs from South East Asia (sample below). Dear Susan is a website devoted to photography and travel, is camera brand agnostic (although some of the contributors use Fuji cameras) and is often a source of interesting viewpoints and polite discussion.  Do take a look and leave a comment. Report · jezo Posted 8 hours ago XT10, moving aperture and shutter to front and back wheels I went a bit further in the thick of the manual and yes, see now that with a 'ringed' lens aperture is not controllable by the dial at all. Given the proliferation of those dials on SLRs and the ease of programming a myriad of other functions onto buttons in Fuji cameras it's very strange they didn't leave this option for the user. Top wheel is a classic, but I'd welcome a choice. Recent Gallery Comments Llandudno Pier By scon4061 · Posted August 12 Thanks, it was shot about 9pm. House 1 By kiwiana · Posted August 11 Gee, I just think your lawns may need mowing. Yes I do like the photos of the old buildings too. Going down to the local village  this morning hoping to get some black and white photos of the early colonial buildings, plenty in this area. Hope it stops raining though. Thanks Rob! Looking toward 'The Blade' - Three Capes Walk, SE Tasmania By Ostravaczech · Posted August 5 WOW! Llandudno Pier By dem · Posted August 3 Very nice. I have been to Llandudno a couple of times and it is always very busy. Bet you had to get up early to get this shot Cloudscapes over Nunhead cemetery By artuk · Posted July 29 I really like this one because of the framing created by the gap in the trees. Having never shot in Infrared, has the foreground been lifted with some DR or HDR technique, or it this just how infrared looks?  Cloudscapes over Nunhead cemetery By GeoffC · Posted July 29 For all the Nunhead shots.   Brilliant.
