Complete SD Kinnikuman set on eBay Started by lhssenior , Yesterday, 04:20 PM Please log in to reply 4 replies to this topic #1 lhssenior lhssenior Toy Addict Beastformers Archaeology 1465 posts Gender:Male Posted Yesterday, 04:20 PM Hi folks, I haven't been very active lately (new house, big promotion, got married, baby on the way, it's been a hell of a year) but just put a bunch of stuff up on eBay including a full set of all 7 parts of the SD Kinnikuman figures. I sold dozens of these here a number of years ago but don't believe a full set has ever been offered, well, anywhere, especially given how rare the part 7 figures are. Take a look and good luck if you place any bids. Cheers! -Barry   https://www.ebay.com...hssenior/m.html   0 Back to top #2 kayfabe1985 kayfabe1985 Serious Collector Members 581 posts Gender:Male Location:Stuttgart, Germany via Chicago, IL Interests:Former Pro Wrestler so naturally Wrestling, Kinnikuman, Saint Seiya, Kinkeshi, Deka Kinkeshi & throw in some AoA! Posted Today, 02:20 AM Tremendous, full disclosure: I will be on this like cheese on a cheeseburger! I am only missing 5 sculpts from Part 7 to have a full/complete set. 0 Back to top #3 Ericnilla Ericnilla Keshi Addict Members 8919 posts Gender:Male Location:SoCal Interests:Customs and Collecting Posted Today, 04:54 AM Tremendous, full disclosure: I will be on this like cheese on a cheeseburger! I am only missing 5 sculpts from Part 7 to have a full/complete set. FYI, I was going to go for these but since you really want them I won't keep after them. My high bid is only $32 so I'm sure it will go over that anyways. Good luck 1 INSTAGRAM Back to top #4 kayfabe1985 kayfabe1985 Serious Collector Members 581 posts Gender:Male Location:Stuttgart, Germany via Chicago, IL Interests:Former Pro Wrestler so naturally Wrestling, Kinnikuman, Saint Seiya, Kinkeshi, Deka Kinkeshi & throw in some AoA!
