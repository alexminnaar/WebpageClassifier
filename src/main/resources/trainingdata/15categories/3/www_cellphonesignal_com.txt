Verizon may have the largest 4G LTE Coverage however the speeds test said a different story here. T-Mobile LTE appears to be spreading rapidly, and is pumping out high speeds. What about Sprint, well, numbers talk by them self. “T-Mobile’s 4G LTE network rollout is moving at a speed that’s unprecedented in the U.S. wireless industry—we’ll go from seven metro areas today to nationwide by the end of the year, with many major metros launching next month,” said T-Mobile U.S. CTO Neville Ray in a statement to PCWorld/TechHive. “T-Mobile’s two 4G services—HSPA 42 and LTE—together produced an average 4G download speed of about 9 mbps in our 20 test cities. That score put T-Mobile in a virtual tie with Verizon LTE for second place . Average upload speeds came in at 2.65 mbps” Source   Read More Nokia Lumia 521 now available from T-Mobile By: t-marco May 23rd, 2013 814399 Commentshttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.cellphonesignal.com%2Fnokia-lumia-521-now-available-from-t-mobile%2FNokia+Lumia+521+now+available+from+T-Mobile+2013-05-23+14%3A35%3A40t-marcohttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.cellphonesignal.com%2F%3Fp%3D8143 The Nokia Lumia 521 has been available for a while on T-Mobile contracts in the US, although you couldn’t actually buy the device from T-Mobile  because  it was exclusive to HSN at launch.
