Savings Champion is the best innovation in savings I have seen in recent years – comprehensive rate tracking, coupled with unbiased help in finding better deals is exactly what savers crave" Dan Hyde, Deputy Personal Finance Editor, Telegraph Media Group "SavingsChampion is a great website for the beleaguered saver. Independent, unbiased and informative!" Mail on Sunday Personal Finance Editor, Jeff Prestridge “You can check on cash interest rates on several websites. I use the best buy tables from www.savingschampion.co.uk which does not promote products on the basis of commission or commercial deals and has a genuinely helpful free helpline answered by experts – if you have more than £100,000 it will even manage it for you to get the best rates for a small fee." - Paul Lewis, Freelance Finance Journalist and Broadcaster, SAGA Magazine We're working for a better deal for savers Savings Champion monitors and advises on the whole UK savings market.
