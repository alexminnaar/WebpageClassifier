This weekend, the shoe’s very first colorway hits select retailers. The true “First Game” colorway, which the King wore in his first NBA game on the road against the Sacramento Kings, will be a limited edition release this Saturday, August 26, at select shops like Sneaker Politics. An amount of pairs each premium retailer will see has not been disclosed, but we can tell you they’ll be scarce so this won’t be an easy score by any means.
