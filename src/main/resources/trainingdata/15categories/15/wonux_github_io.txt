I am a communication engineer working in China Unicom. After work I am a Linux amateur. The first time I used Linux in college，I fell in love with it. As the famous saying goes，"where there is shell,there is a way". It is really cool to work with the command line in the terminal. I Like Unix philosophy and opon source software. I agree with what DistroWatch said "Put the fun back into computing.Use Linux,BSD." My favourite Linux distribution is gentoo, as well as arch. And I also dabble in C, C++ and Python. I also often contribute to open source projects and beta test startup products. My Projects Weibo My personal media, which shares my daily life, articles and news.
