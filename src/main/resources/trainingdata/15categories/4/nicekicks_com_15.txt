The Van Doren Rubber Company was unique in that it manufactures shoes and sells them directly to the public. On that first morning, 12 customers purchase shoes which are made that day and ready for pick-up in the afternoon. The Vans #44 deck shoes, which is now known as the Authentic were born. Ever since Vans has continued to forge innovative collaborations through the Vault by BVans line with Vans sneaker combinations with design giant Marc Jacobs and OC up-and-comers Trovata flying off the shelves.
