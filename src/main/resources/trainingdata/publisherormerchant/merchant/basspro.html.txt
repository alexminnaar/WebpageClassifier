Compare Add more to compare Added Description Reviews Q&A The Sightmark® Ultra Shot Plus Reflex Sight provides rapid target acquisition for ARs, shotguns, hunting rifles, and competition handguns. The Ultra Shot Plus is a trim, lightweight sight that provides a wide field of view, enabling shooters to pick up the reticle quickly with both eyes open, maintaining peripheral vision and depth perception while shooting. Five brightness settings and 4 illuminated reticle patterns in either red or green allow you to find the optimum reticle in any environment, from full daytime to complete darkness. The sight is fully adjustable for windage and elevation. An aluminum body, with a matte black finish, provides durability; and the integral quick-detach mount attaches the sight directly to Weaver or Picatinny rails; and removes quickly when iron sights or other tactical sights are wanted. The Sightmark Core Shot Pro Spec Reflex Sight runs on a common CR2 battery for up to 1,000 hours. Manufacturer model #: SM26008. Provides rapid target acquisition Allows shooting with both eyes open Four reticle patterns in red or green Five brightness settings Integral quick-detach mount Powered by 1 common CR2 battery Web ID: 1510141130 Rated 5 out of 5 by ms2413 from WOW my next door neighbors young son (19) just bought an AR-15 from BPS. Panther gun= DPRS i believe it is? anyway. He ask me to take him to my local gun range "PHA" here in Churchland NC!! I love to take a young man or girl shooting!!!! I figured we spend hrs messing w/ this thing to get it sighted in right! I'm a 54 yrs oid guy & Army Vet, avid reloader & consider myself a pretty good marksman OK. Well my friend, let me say, it wasn't long before i had 3 hole touching @ 25yrd w/ the green dot postion! OMG, i thought can this be for real!! Went to a 100 yd target, shot 12" high w' 5 shot group the size of a navel orange!! Huum?? Whats going on! Come to find out that the sight had come loose on the rail, just barely hanging on, because we did not have the adjustment nut tight enough on the clamp bracket bolt/ locking lever! Made adjustments went back to the 25 yd target, within mins were shooting a 5 shot group the size of a quarter!!! Make sure you use the crosshair postion for more accur shooting than the solid DOT. I don't own a black gun but if i ever get one, this will be the sight i purchase! For a $100 bucks, this baby is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Date published: 2017-05-21 Rated 5 out of 5 by cw225 from Very dependable!! I got one to run on my AR15 and love it. It is very durable and extremely reliable. Sighting in is easy and even when removed from the rifle with the quick detach it doesn't seem to loose zero when I put it back on. I purchased another one to put on my 300 blackout. Date published: 2017-01-31 Rated 5 out of 5 by Ben01 from A Snipers Perspective My buddies gave me a hard time for putting the $150 optic on my service rifle. I wanted to see if it could compete with the more expensive products I am used to and I was sold. I have absolutly beaten this item and it has survived. From operating in the swamps of North Carolina to the 115 degree desert of Arizona, I will be a lifetime Sightmark customer. You can not beat this product for the price. Date published: 2016-11-28 Rated 1 out of 5 by lsdclimber from Disappointing Bought this sight only to find out Windage adjustment didn't not click when adjusting the sight making it very difficult to get on target. Returned it to the store and bought ammo instead. Optics tech in-store confirmed that the sight was defective. I will be reluctant to purchase Sight mark products in the future. Date published: 2016-11-15 Rated 5 out of 5 by Russell from Great product, considering price. Build quality is great. One of the most important things I was looking for in such a product is the type of battery. This particular model took CR123 battery, so it's a common battery to replace, nothing too expensive or hard to get a hold of. The product holds its zero, nice and bright. Date published: 2016-08-17 Rated 5 out of 5 by Chief from On target! I find this sight to be the right combination of price and function. The construction is more robust than expected and the quick release mount is a convenient feature. There have been no issues with holding zero while being mounted on a 7.62x39 rifle. Switching between reticle types can cause a shift in zero, but this can be remedied by always moving the reticle selection lever to the one desired and then wiggling it a tiny bit. The choices of brightness level cover everything that I have encountered while shooting. Keep the orifice clean where the LED is located and your reticle shapes will look like they are supposed to. A definite repeat purchase for me. Date published: 2016-08-06 Rated 5 out of 5 by Jshooter3717 from Winner Picked this little guy up from a local bass pro shops at the request of on of their counter guys. So far I am impressed. Good battery life, mounting was easy, held zero and tracked well. Have about 200-300 rounds through it. Good experience so far. Date published: 2016-06-01 Rated 3 out of 5 by MSGAZ from Good, lower-cost conscious, optic. I was looking for a minimal-expense, shielded, effective optic for a low-use reliable home defense platform. The optional reticles and the red/green illumination option work well. The protruding design/length of the quick release handle, affords a high potential to snag on items (result, an optic on the ground. It meet my needs, maybe yours too.

Asked by: ML26 when switching reticles do I have to re-zero Asked by: Kobosh Per the Manufacturer - &quot;No you will not have to re zero when switching reticles&quot; Answered by: BPSResource8 Date published: 2017-05-31 Do I need bases to mount this on my Mossberg 835 Ultimag What bases do I need? Asked by: Wxlt You will need a picatinny/weaver base to mount this optic. Answered by: BPSResource19 Date published: 2017-05-31 Can this work on a Remington 7600 .308 If so what would I need to mount it? Asked by: Explorer722 Thank you for your inquiry about the Sightmark Ultra Shot Plus Reflex Sight. Per the manufacturer, Yes it will on that specific model. You will just need to make sure the gun has a weaver or picitany rail on top. Answered by: BPSResource3 Date published: 2017-05-31 Will this sight co-witness with Magpul MBUS? Asked by: vb3391 Thank you for your question! Yes this item will co-witness with Magpul MBUS. Answered by: BPSResource14 Date published: 2017-05-31 Is their an attachment I can add to my rib on my shot gun to make it compatible with this sight? Asked by: joepizza If the &quot;rib&quot; you have is the standard dovetail mount that comes on many shotguns you can use a dovetail to picatinny adapter sometimes referred to as a dovetail to picatinny riser. If it is a Remmington 870, Firefield makes a saddle mount that provides a picatinny rail for mounting. It is the FF34007. Answered by: Sightmark Expert Date published: 2017-05-31 will it work for a 12 gauge shotgun? Asked by: lalito The integral quick-detach mount attaches the sight directly to Weaver or Picatinny rails. If you have this mounting style on your 12 Gauge Shotgun then it should work well.
