Yes, Probably Jul 28, 2017 - 3:13 PM - by AutoGuide.com <span lang="EN-US"></span> Honda updated its elemental Civic with an all-new model that hit the road in 2010 as a 2011 model and carried through until an all-new-for-2017 model replaced it last year. With selection galore, numerous trim grades, performance levels and both coupe and sedan body styles, theres a used Civic out there thats just perfect for whatever your needs are. The Civic was even available as a hybrid, but well be focusing on more mainstream-powered versions of the Civic in this used car report. <span lang="EN-US">Read more about the Honda Civic at AutoGuide.com.</span> 0 Replies | 37 Views 2018 Honda Accord Debuts With Turbo Engines, 10-Speed Transmission Jul 25, 2017 - 5:11 PM - by AutoGuide.com Quote: The 2018 Honda Accord sedan was just revealed to the world and it has been completely overhauled. This perennially popular midsize offering gains turbocharged engines, a more rigid structure, an advanced 10-speed automatic gearbox, and even a physical volume knob for the audio system. Talk about progress! Dimensionally, this 10th-generation Accord remains essentially the same size as todays version. Its wheelbase has been stretched by a little more than two inches, though it is more than half an inch lower. Width has grown by 0.39 inches, while overall length is fractionally less.

The Japanese automaker today unveiled its new Civic Type-R racecar for the TCR International Series. The car will be prepared by Italian outfit JAS Motorsport and will first take to the track early next year when the 2018 racing season kicks off. Unlike many motorsports competitions, the TCR Series uses cars that are based heavily on their production versions. The stock engine is used, though output is limited to 300 horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque. Hondas Civic Type-R entry uses the stock engine, but builds on the package with a race-approved aerodynamics package, a different multi-link rear suspension setup, a racing ECU and an FIA-approved roll cage.
