Being an old lady ByRBon December 26, 2015 Color: Blue/Tan|Verified Purchase I love it. Being an old lady, I still have 45's from the sixties and seventies. Old albums, too. I was looking for good sound quality, not too expensive, and something I didn't have to connect to the computer. This came recommended in a magazine that I trust, so I thought I give it a try. I'm glad I did. Read more 0Comment| 9 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?YesNoSending feedback... Thank you for your feedback. Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Meyeron February 22, 2016 Color: Blue/Tan|Verified Purchase I wasn't expecting great quality-- just something functional, and fun for my 12 year old daughter. I ended up returning 2 units (was hoping the first one was simply "bad luck"). The craftsmanship is extremely poor. On the second unit, for example, the platter was so warped that it scraped against a plastic part beneath the platter every rotation. There is absolutely no quality control.

Being an old lady ByRBon December 26, 2015 Color: Blue/Tan|Verified Purchase I love it. Being an old lady, I still have 45's from the sixties and seventies. Old albums, too. I was looking for good sound quality, not too expensive, and something I didn't have to connect to the computer. This came recommended in a magazine that I trust, so I thought I give it a try. I'm glad I did. Read more 0Comment| 9 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?YesNoSending feedback... Thank you for your feedback. Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

ByDomesticArtiston March 1, 2016 Color: Blue/Tan|Verified Purchase Great record player for someone who just wants to play records and doesn't want a lot of external hardware to contend with. The sound is great, and it's portable and small enough to place anywhere in your home. It's especially great for a small space. Read more 0Comment| 6 people found this helpful.

Ended up being defective (needle wouldn't stay down on the record hard enough for it to play on some records) and I returned it and bought an audiotechnica instead. I does look neat though.

Meyeron February 22, 2016 Color: Blue/Tan|Verified Purchase I wasn't expecting great quality-- just something functional, and fun for my 12 year old daughter. I ended up returning 2 units (was hoping the first one was simply "bad luck"). The craftsmanship is extremely poor. On the second unit, for example, the platter was so warped that it scraped against a plastic part beneath the platter every rotation. There is absolutely no quality control.
