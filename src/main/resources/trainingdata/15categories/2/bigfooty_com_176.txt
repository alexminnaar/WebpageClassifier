Hawks Vs Dogs - lots of farewells here. Two semi finalists from last year with both looking like missing finals action. 2. Eagles Vs Crows - How will the Crows play this? All out assault? Will the Eagles be still a chance for 8th? 3. Tigers Vs Saints - Another farewell game but more interesting is the fact the Tigers are playing for the double chance. Saints should be confident having beaten them recently. Will it happen again? 4. Pies Vs Dees - Think this could be a very close game. Pies would love to possibly stop Melb from making the 8. 5. Power Vs Suns - How much % can the Power build without losing any players to injury or suspension? 6. Swans Vs Blues - See game 5 above. 7. Cats Vs Giants - the only thing that interests me here is the final result and who finishes second. Won't be watching. #freekickgeelong 8. Lions Vs Roos - If the Lions are serious they should win comfortably.   brad, Aug 22, 2017 at 7:00 AM #1 Reply (Log in to remove this ad.)

As petty as having a hissy when a thread is created by a special someone. 9. Ess v Freo meh who cares? 8. Swans v Blues same, same. 7. Port v suns who wants to watch Port beat up another bottom team before going out straight sets? 6. Hawks v Bulldogs how this game got the friday night and not Geelong v GWS is beyond me, will be a scrappy, bad game. Luke who? 5. Tigers v Saints again, a non game. Bottom 5 are all meaningless when it comes to finals, neither team play an exciting brand of footy 4. Pies v Dees. Demons will turn it on, and watching Eddie's face is always priceless after a 100point thumping 3. Geelong v GWS. Cracking game, home team up and about. Win we secure top 2 and a home final v Richmond at their ground. Lose and we play Adelaide away. A lot on the line 2. Eagle v Crows. Another cracking game, Adelaide might as well rest their team, Eagles will come out hard needing the win to play finals 1. SPOONBALL/SPOONBOWL/SPOONCUP. Love it, cracking game, and if not for Geelong v GWS should've been the friday night match. Give the lucky lad who's going to North next year a front row seat on the bench and let him take the esky full of xxxx or vb's out at half time and hand them out.   JohnZ, Aug 22, 2017 at 8:33 AM #2 Reply Requiem, Carlos Danger, KissKiss and 1 other person like this. JayJ20 Premium Gold Essendon Other teams: Joined: Aug 16 Posts: 4,341 1. Richmond vs St Kilda - can Richmond sew up their first top 4 finish since 2001? 2. Melbourne vs Collingwood - Melbourne with a chance to sew up their first finals campaign since 2006. 3. West Coast vs Adelaide - This could drop to the bottom if Essendon have a big win over Fremantle. If we have a small win, then this will certainly be the most interesting game for every Essendon fan 4. Brisbane vs North - Brisbane could hand North their first spoon in over 40 years 5. Geelong vs GWS - Winner gets home final. Other than that, should be a close game 6. Hawthorn vs Bulldogs - Not really as interested as I was anymore. Hopefully Hawthorn end their mathematical finals chances. 7. Sydney vs Carlton - Still an interesting game 8. Port Adelaide vs Gold Coast - still an interesting game Every game is pretty interesting this round   Last edited: Aug 22, 2017 at 7:36 PM JayJ20, Aug 22, 2017 at 9:01 AM #3 Reply blitzer Premiership Player Essendon Other teams: Joined: Aug 06 Posts: 3,647 Location: House 1. West Coast vs Adelaide - The main thing I care about is checking we've made the 8. Also collecting a free lunch from my Eagles mate if we finish above Eagles as well. Go Crows! 2. Melbourne vs Collingwood - I expect Melbourne to win this comfortably with Collingwood's outs but I'll still be interested because it impacts Essendon significantly. If they lose we could end up in 7th which will shift our matchups. Hope Melbourne win though - they deserve finals. 3. Brisbane vs North - Wooden spoon cup. I feel a little invested in this because I had predicted that North would be a chance for the spoon this year. In fairness I think they have been a bit stiff with some match results and were in general more competitive than expected. Anyway it would be good to see Brisbane win. 4. Cats vs Giants - Should be a good game although I reckon with Cats current outs they won't be able to handle the Giants. I also don't find the Cats as exciting without Dangerwood together. 5. Hawks vs Bulldogs - Should be a good contest. Unlikely to matter though in terms of finals. Other than that I don't really care about the games other than hoping that results fall our way so we don't have to play Sydney first up in the finals who in my mind are clearly a top 3 team this year. However its not really enough to make me care about any of the individual matches because its too difficult to work out who we will be vsing as so many of the games affect the finals matchups.   blitzer, Aug 22, 2017 at 9:33 AM #4 Reply jason pm Norm Smith Medallist Brisbane Lions Other teams: Fortitude Valley Diehards Joined: Aug 15 Posts: 8,543 Location: the scenic rim It's obviously the Paddy Dow index clash at the Gabba at number 1 surely.   jason pm, Aug 22, 2017 at 9:41 AM #5 Reply Requiem and Shinboner roo like this.

Brisbane vs North doesn't have implications for the 8. But it does have a side of intrigue attached to it though, I'll concede. Hawthorn vs WB is irrelevant apart from being a massive farewell game.   harrythetiger, Aug 22, 2017 at 11:39 AM #10 Reply Runk Brownlow Medallist Essendon Other teams: Not important Joined: Sep 03 Posts: 10,005 Location: under the table JohnZ said: ↑ I'm including my own team, because I see it as a top game #freekickgeelong?

What has that got anything to do with what I said? If you're going to number games 1 to 8 then do it without starting potential shit fights with posters. It was a post designed to offer nothing but antagonism.

Not saying Giants cats isn't the MVP match however you said that dogs Hawks holds no bearing on the top 8. If dogs win and freo upset essendon however unlikely the dogs just need tigers to beat saints and crows to beat eagles to make finals.   dean33, Aug 22, 2017 at 3:41 PM #23 Reply Donakebab Premium Gold Essendon Other teams: Detroit Red Wings Joined: May 09 Posts: 24,162 Location: Tempy LukeParkerno1 said: ↑ 1.
