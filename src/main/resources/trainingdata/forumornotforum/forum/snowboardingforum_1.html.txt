I left work at lunch time thursday the 15th went home packed our things and hit the road. Drove till about 2am and had to pull over to get some shut eye at a rest area which was pretty tough because the temps were -7. Slept till 6 and continued on to Killington. got there right at 9 and OMG was it cold. Wind was blowing and the temps at the base were -8. The snow was really slow as a result and ended up pedaling a lot throughout the day in the many flat sections of the trail. Thank god for the gondola if not for that we wouldn't have been able to stay much longer than an hour. I felt like they had enough trails open to keep us entertained for the entire day. Saturday we went to pico which ended up being the best day of the whole trip. It was our first time ever riding on fresh powder and OMG what a treat. We rode everything they had open except for the double blacks. It was also our first time riding glades and it was a blast! My 9 year old son liked it so much he used his birthday money to buy the summit glades trail sign . Once the lifts shut down loaded up and headed to smugglers notch where we were staying the rest of the week. Sunday we drove up to jay peak which was kind of a disappointment. It rained half the day and the fog was so bad you could only see 20' in front of you and to top it off the tram and the flyer quad were down so you couldn't even get up to the top of the mountain. Monday was the first of four days at smuggs. All the rain from the day before turned the entire mountain into a block of ice. They did a good job grooming the trails but it was still kind of scary. On one of the steeper trails i even slid off into the woods which was pretty frightening. So we decided to stay over on Morse mountain where the snow was a little softer and practice switch riding and buttering. Temps stayed in the teens and lower 20s so the trails stayed pretty hard until thursday when we got some fresh snow which made the riding alot better but I was already so sore from falling on the ice all week it really wasn't very enjoyable to ride. I gotta say it was an awesome trip though and I definitely want to go back to Jay Peak on a good day when they have fresh snow and all the lifts are running. Next year we'll plan to go in late January/early February when the conditions should better. Anyone have any advice on where to stay cheap around jay peak? Kenai and trippinsoul like this.

It was definitely a tough week to be up here, but at least you also had the one good day to see pow at Pico. Unfortunately I've had quite a few similar trips in my life where the trip was good but the conditions were bad. It sounds like you both kept a great attitude and you should definitely try to make it back later in the season! Jay really is a great place when the conditions are good so keep it on the list. I'm sorry I don't have cheap lodging suggestions as my wife's cousin lives at the base of the hill so we have a free guest room and we even get to bring the dogs!

This kid isn't going to remember fog, ice and freezing temps so much as his dad driving through the night, shredding days on end and feeding his stoke. An important reminder (to me, at least) of the importance of perspective. extra0, MassSnowboarder, phillyphan and 1 others like this. rpadc is offline   Quote Quick Reply post #5 of 9 (permalink) Old 12-25-2016, 10:03 AM snowangel99 Veteran Member     Join Date: Mar 2016 Location: Norway Posts: 872 Mentioned: 9 Post(s) Tagged: 0 Thread(s) Quoted: 456 Post(s) I agree, you are an awesome Dad!!!! Wow! How many hours did you guys drive total? There are a couple of group trips (you can drive yourself) to Jay Peak and the rates can't be beat. I can email them to you. I also ride with my kids....but we are still on greens and hopefully blues soon.

Then 3 hours from there to smugglers (because it was snowing). 3 hour round trip from smuggs to jay peak again because of the weather. The final leg of the trip from smuggs back home was 12.5 hours. I wouldn't hesitate to do it again! Pm me the info on the group trip snowangel99 likes this.

The conditions were really good at that point, but we did hear about the poorer conditions earlier in the week. Regardless, it sounds like you guys had a great time. I didn't see too many hotels/motels on the way to, except for one just north of the resort on 108, maybe something to checkout. You could probably find it on google maps.

About 15 minutes from Jay. I think I paid $50 for the night. Very friendly staff.
