Posted 17 November 2009 - 07:24 PM This is an official LRG thread designed to warn community members about dishonest eBay/LRG members. Because we have developed a zero tolerance policy for dishonest trading or selling, this thread will be for only banned members that were found to be dishonest in their selling or trading behavior. The goal of this thread is to post factual information based on other threads and/or eBay auctions. Please feel free to post additional information in this thread. Eventually a LRG Moderator will incorporate pertinent information into official posts. Excess posts will be deleted after the information has been added, or dismissed, in an effort to keep the thread simple, clean, and straight forward. It is the duty of ALL board members to make sure they are leaving accurate feedback and informing the mods of any trades/sales/purchases gone bad. This allows us to help resolve any misunderstandings/minor infractions, stay informed/document, and (if all else fails) ultimately ban problematic members. Also, please note: When dealing with a new or unverified member, it is in YOUR best interest to have them send first (assuming that you have adequate feedback) or at the very minimum, broker it through eBay. Don't become an example of the old saying, "A fool and his money are soon parted!"

Posted 17 November 2009 - 07:25 PM LRG Name: arforbes eBay names: yapiel, balucard, monkeyroxy Real Name: Alexander Forbes Locations: arforbes - Glendale, AZ (100% true) yapiel - ? balucard - claims Toronto, ON, Canada monkeyroxy - claims Hauppauge, NYBrief Overview: Alex had a knack for ripping off new collectors, which did not get him banned, but is worth noting and warning new collectors. He also pulled a scam where he bought and shilled with duplicate eBay accounts. While this should have got him banned a long time ago, he was given a second chance. The activity that got him banned was having another duplicate account and pretending to sell MUSCLE figures from Canada, because Canadian auctions tend to have rare (and expensive) figures. There was also some fear he may be resealing MUSCLE 4-packs. Even after he is banned members unavoidably observe and report his dishonest and odd behavior. Other Notes: Balucard: Claims to be military that is stationed in AZ, the "islands", and other locations.Notable Threads: Arforbes admits to being Yapiel In a move that should have got Alex banned he admits to having two eBay accounts (arforbes and yapiel). The yapiel account was used to drive up prices and buy additional rare figures so people would not know he had multiple rare figures. Arforbes/Yapiel buys a BHS for $910 Arforbes already owns the figure, but buys another one with the yapiel for $910. This is an example of the deceitfulness of Alex. Balucard/Arforbes/Yapiel tries to sell a SC 4-Pack Alex pretends to be from Canada because figures from Canada tend to be rarer and sell for higher prices. Additionally he is trying to hide how many of each figure he actually has because it would lessen the value of the figures. Plus posting as arforbes allows him to continually publicize his own auctions. He is eventually caught because he tries to sell a SC in a sealed 4-pack. The buyers from other colored eBay auctions from balucard confirm all the suspicions. Arforbes gets a negative feedback on eBay Gollum got a negative feedback on eBay. He uses the balucard eBay account to leave a retaliatory feedback. General Veers realizes Alex screwed him over some time ago Alex refuses to send figures I bought a few years ago. Balucard buys another SHA Alex continues to disappoint. Everybody knows he is Balucard, but he still wants to use the account. He could simply use his arforbes account. He was likely looking to shill and walk away, or hoping to get it cheap (at least in his mind). Alex lashes out and tries to blackmail the LRG Alex tries to bother General Veers on another message board and then attempts to threaten and blackmail the LRG message board. He exhibits disruptive and underhanded behavior in an effort to suggest he didn't engage in disruptive and underhanded behavior. A new board member reports that Alex is sadly still up to his same old games. In an effort to sell a SC 4-Pack, Alex once again creates a fake eBay account, says heâ€™s somewhere else, and ships from Arizona. Alex moves up from scamming LRG collectors to scamming GI Joe collectors. In a nutshell, Alex bought a MOSC Stormshadow missing the peg tag, then tries to sell the same figure after having re-inserted a peg tab as "unpunched". After being called out, he says that the tab is still attached at the bottom, but backside pics of the first auction show that there is clearly no tab attached. Alex, in cahoots with a fake feedback seller account (whether his or a buddy's) blames us for it, all the while knowing exactly who the seller is. A obviously fake purple claw auction was listed on eBay, location was "Surprise, AZ". This was an open jab at Alex, who had just gotten through shill bidding up (and winning) his own purple claw auction. An auction that he posted hours after the one General Veers had listed, undoubtedly in an attempt to devalue Veers' auction. Anyways, Alex cried on CTL that it was one of us who had posted the auction to try to slander him. Well, it turns out that Alex has had at least 1 "transaction" with this fake feedback seller account. As documented in the link above. Just another instance of how dishonest Alex is. Create fake drama and then lie about it to try to slander someone here. Alex tried to pass off a dyed #189 M.U.S.C.L.E. as a possible "FACTORY ERROR". A obviously dyed #189 was listed on eBay. Alex listed it as either a factory error or a stained figure, stating that in his opinion, it was a legitimate factory error. Any MUSCLE collector who has been around for a while knows about dying figures with RIT and the common characteristics when you do (mottled coloring, lighter coloring in the crevices, etc). Alex definitely knew the figure was dyed and tried to bait new collectors into thinking it was somehow rare. Same Alex, trying to dupe new collectors out of their money. The surprising bit was that he used his main arforbes ebay account to run the scam. Seller claims that Alex rips her off for $7600. Alex won a mixed lot of figures for $7600 that contained a super rare Class A figure (red #68). After receiving them he filed an ebay claim to return the figures and won. The seller claims that he swapped out a few of the figures and sent the rest back. Ebay supposedly refunded Alex but was unable to get the money back from the seller because she emptied her paypal.

Mr Forbes stole almost half of them and replaced different ones. What a thief. The best part eBay gave him a refund....go figure! It will be a long day in hell before I pay them. I'm sure the toy chat lines would be buzzing if they knew the outcome of what I'm dealing with. Laura - funatsales65 And after seeing that she had indeed pegged him as a thief on the feedback: (Image from the U of M write up on the situation: http://blog.uofmuscl...-of-march-23rd/ Dear funatsales65, I heard you got ripped off for that $7500 Muscle lot. If that is true, you should call yours and his local police stations and file a report. $7500 is beyond grand theft and is a felony. Jail time... - littlerubberguys Dear littlerubberguys, Thanks for your email. You heard right!! Rgh! I'm sitting pondering what I should be doing. Ebay has refunded the funds back to him. Go figure!! I appreciate your input. Im working on a solution but it's very time consuming. Laura Dear funatsales65, Ah, I didn't realize you were in Canada. That makes it international wire fraud, right? Did you at least clear the funds from paypal before they refunded him? - littlerubberguys Dear littlerubberguys, I did remove the funds instantly. Don't know what happens If I don't give it back and I don't really care either. I reported to ic3.gov, hopefully they will put an end to this scammer. Is international wire fraud worse? - funatsales65 Dear funatsales65, IC3.gov won't do anything. Your best bet is to call his local police station and report the incident. If you Google his zip code and the word police, then you can get the number to his local police department. You can file the police report and then call ebay with the report number. Last thing you want is for eBay to try to come after you for the money when Alex clearly ripped you off. - littlerubberguys The end of this particular story has a positive outcome though. Apparently she appealed and won and Alex did not succeed with his felonious attempt to rip her off for a figure he initally paid $7600 for.NOTE: You should be very wary if you deal with Alex, as is well documented above. 0 I will always place the mission first.

Posted 17 November 2009 - 07:25 PM LRG Name: DiplotmatX eBay names: suga456, kingdomheartx, iphonewholesaler Email: Usually uses some form of kingdomheartx or his usual email diplomatx19@yahoo.com Location: Miami, Florida Brief Overview: He was banned for lying about a highly desirable MUSCLE figure, a magenta Claw, in an eBay auction. Additional shady behavior did not help his case. After being banned, he tried to reclaim PayPal money from TheGodbeast. Notable Threads: The Magenta Claw Auction This is the auction that got him banned. He was intentionally vague in the auction, did not answer questions in the thread, and then lied to General Veers about the original source of the figure. The severity of this was increased because of the potential excitement around a Magenta Claw discovery, plus a history of similar vagueness and overall deviousness with his sales. Odd eBay Situation DiplomatX listed some 4" Keshi and pretended they were not his figures. Another board member realized it was him. While not the reason he was banned it is an example of his dishonesty and generally odd behavior. Selling Custom 2-piece SC as Authentic MUSCLE General Veers, again, catches this idiot is trying to pass off a TheGodBeast custom figure as an authentic Super Rare figure. The custom is a flesh 2-piece SC. DiplomatX PayPal Credit Card Scam (After Being Banned) TheGodbeast reported that DiplomatX is trying to reclaim PayPal money from months ago on items that were delivered. Thankfully TGB has receipts showing the shipment and delivery confirmation. 0 I will always place the mission first. I will never accept defeat. I will never quit.

He then offered board members 2nd chance offers when he had shill bid the price too high. He also stiffed, at least, one collector who won an auction on the mat-teo account by not sending the items (although no money changed hands). He then tried to sell the same items on his CHEAPTOYMAN eBay account. Notable Threads: Veers' detailed write-up on why Cheaptoyman was banned.

Posted 17 November 2009 - 07:26 PM LRG Name: Dark Clown, DerrioEight eBay Names: ancsanamun, v-olator Other Nicknames: Sven Dollar Real Name: J B Location: Berlin, Germany Brief Overview: Manipulated trade deals by falsely claiming a higher offer, mis-representing BB Bootlegs to a member as Prototypes, and multiple areas of questionable integrity. Notable information: (1) Dark Clown sent a pm to matthewf1tz (who inquired about his BB & LB bootlegs) clearly stating, "are prototypes of Battle Beasts" and also covered himself by saying, "but I'am not sure at all." DISHONEST collectors use phrases like, "but I'am not sure at all" & "I think" to cover them self while seeing if they can get another collector or collectors into believing the toy could be a prototype (way more rare) & worth more $$$. (2) Dark Clown stated in a pm to TGB that Roland13 offered "$150 per BB bootleg & $180 per LB bootleg." The true offer in Roland13's pm to Dark Clown was $100 for 4 of the bootlegs (one being a LB bootleg). This was done in an attempt to keep the value of his BB & LB bootlegs high (falsifying the true offer). 0 I will always place the mission first. I will never accept defeat. I will never quit.

It sounds like his basic scam was having people send Western Union transfers or Money Orders, then not sending the items. Notable information: LRG members talk about being scammed by instant karma.

Have had 2 unfortunate instances with 'buyer'. Counting up at least a dozen claims over past few weeks, that I know of.

I was worried, but I ultimately did get my figures as described (he also threw in a bonus figure that was slightly damaged, but still pretty nice and displayable). They took well over a month to get here and he didn't respond to my emails asking about the status, but they did show up so I guess that's the most important thing.

Posted 09 June 2013 - 12:27 AM I got royally screwed out of my very first series 2 cheap toy by somebody listed above. A few months ago a bunch of novo toys turned up on eBay and I ended up bidding on one of them and won it super cheap. Unbeknownst to the Canadian seller, his auctions weren't appearing on eBay.com but they did appear on eBay.ca and eBay international. When I posted up in this other forum that I'd won a figure, initially I was congratulated by the forum but the next day I got an email from the seller saying he was cancelling my auction and all the other novo auctions. When I asked him why he said that he'd been offered a substantial amount for them and it was an offer he couldn't refuse. I posted up what happened on this other forum basically explaining how the seller withdrew his toys. That got deleted a few hours afterwards. A day or so after that I got a PM from one of the moderators saying that him and ^ bought them up because they didn't want the toys ending up all over the world. I was offered the toy I won back for the price I paid for it IF I threw in some split kits. I didn't hear anything for a week or so, so I PM'ed the mod and asked what was going on. He told me that the deal went sour and they didn't bother buying them in the end so I contacted the seller to ask if they were still available, if so, I'd still like to buy one. I never got a reply nor did the figures ever resurface on eBay or any forum or collection. A couple of back and forth PMs from the site owner asking if I was ok as I hadn't posted in a while was full of lies and contradiction. The guy claimed he'd banned a few people because of it and some people owed him an apology. I can see how people could get drawn into this sort of thing but I'm not biting so in this instance I'm just avoiding that place and that guy. I was contacted recently by someone from the forum saying that they had also been deceived so I'm glad to be shot of the place. I was going to send this in a PM but in all honesty I'd like people to be aware of this sort of thing. While I wouldn't want anybody to change their opinions of someone based on MY experience perhaps it's worth airing on the side of caution if you do deal with someone like this namely someone listed above. While they may appear to be an "online buddy" it doesn't hurt to keep your guard up and play some things close to the chest. 0 MISSING: Still Jill series 2 Cheap toy. It's not mine, but it might be yours. If willing please trade or sell to me. Thank you!

It seemed like an obvious mistake to me, so I followed up asking for a revised/correct invoice. Nothing. More than a week goes by and I send a message to the seller asking them to cancel the purchase as they obviously didn't intend to fix the invoice. I received this reply an hour later: "price is as mentioned. I will open non-paying bidder case", so I left him a negative feedback and moved on. Three days later I received a dispute case notice, so I followed up again explaining the situation to eBay and again receiving no reply. Today I noticed the seller had relisted the item even though the case is still open. It has a bid too, so I'm hoping it's not anyone here.    Since the card is in crap condition I had intended to open it as I'm looking for mint copies of both the Tortoise and Boar figures at the moment, but this has not been worth the hassle. It just sucks that eBay is hiding my negative feedback on this seller while the case continues, and all the while he's running more auctions.   http://www.ebay.com/...=item1c3ee1bc8f Edited by bachamn, 11 April 2014 - 11:37 AM. 1 Instagram eBay Auctions Wants List Back to top #24 imperfecz imperfecz Götter Members 4424 posts Gender:Male Location:Arizona Interests:stuff n stuff Posted 11 April 2014 - 11:34 AM Sounds like he's not even selling what's in the picture...

I asked what would happen with the seller, and they mentioned that the negative feedback I left would be wiped when the case is closed so basically, nothing. I asked if there was any way they could get the feedback to stick as a warning to other buyers since this guy obviously doesn't know what he's doing, and their reply was that I could pay for the invoice if I wanted the feedback to remain because their system only allows feedback with payment (which I know isn't the case as I've left feedback for canceled purchases before)   Am I the only one who sees this as a pretty damn big loophole that allows sellers to back out of a sale if they don't get the price they want? Just send a huge overcharge on the invoice, don't reply to any messages, and file a non-paying bidder dispute case. No visible repercussions and you get to try again for more cash.  Edited by bachamn, 11 April 2014 - 12:14 PM. 0 Instagram eBay Auctions Wants List Back to top Page 1 of 2 1 2 Next Back to Marketplace Discussion Reply to quoted posts     Clear     LittleRubberGuys.com Forums → Marketplace → Marketplace Discussion Privacy Policy Change Theme IP.Board IP.Board Mobile IBR Caja Help Community Forum Software by IP.Board 3.4.4 Copyright © 2017 LittleRubberGuys.com   Sign In Need an account?
