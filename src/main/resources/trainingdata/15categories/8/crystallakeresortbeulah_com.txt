Crystal Lake Resort on beautiful Crystal Lake Crystal Lake Resort on beautiful Crystal Lake ↓ Skip to Main Content Menu Welcome to Crystal Lake Resort Located on Beautiful Crystal Lake in Beulah, Michigan Crystal Lake is one of the finest recreational lakes in the world. Crystal Lake is appropriately named for it's crystal clear appearance due to its sandy shores and a bottom that is deeper than Lake Erie . These characteristic results in water that is crystal clear with visibility to a depth of 20-30 feet making snorkeling great fun for young and old alike. A double sandbar allows you to walk out into the lake a good distance and take a stroll into town while still in the lake. This also keeps boating close to shores down and creates a safer swimming environment. You can enjoy trout fishing in the summer, and ice fishing in the winter. For year round enjoyment take a scenic drive around Crystal Lake or bring your bike and hiking shoes and use the newly built hiking/biking trails. Crystal Lake is surrounded on three sides by Lake Michigan . The lake is rectangular in shape about nine miles long by three miles wide. Crystal Lake is perfect for sailing, cruising, canoeing, wake boarding and even parasailing. And, it's a water-skiing and ski jet paradise! From our location on the east shores of Crystal Lake you can sit on the beach or our patio and view breath taking sunsets year round. Reservations and Availability >> .
