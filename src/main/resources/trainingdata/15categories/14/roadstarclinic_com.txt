Thanks for your continued patience,   Straightening Bent Exhaust Flanges Monday, 02 March 2009 Introduction Exhaust Header, Showing Warped Flange I went to remove my aftermarket exhaust pipes the other day, but they wouldn't come off. At first, everything looked normal: The exhaust header-studs looked fine. Those four, chrome, exhaust-flange nuts weren't rusty or visibly damaged. In fact, they were new this year. The flange--that part that rattles around when the pipe is off--looked good to me. Nevertheless, after easily removing the flange nuts, I simply could not coax the flange of either pipe off the header-studs. I wiggled; I prodded; I pulled; I angled; I even pried a little. Somehow, it seemed the exhaust-studs had become wedged tightly against the outer edge of both flange bolt-holes. It actually appeared that the exhaust-studs had become bent in a direction away from the center of the exhaust-port. Ultimately, I decided to use a hammer and cold-chisel on the end of one exhaust-stud, to bend it back toward the center of its exhaust-port. This released the flange, and the pipe fell into my hands with relative ease. Of course, I was now committed to replacing the exhaust header studs, since I had just ruined one of them. In any case, when I examined the previously flat, quarter-inch thick, solid steel exhaust flange, I could see it had been bowed to a very large degree. Then I knew what happened. I remembered that the nuts went onto the studs much further than with the stock pipes (which have thicker flanges). I had dutifly torqued the nuts, which was something I hadn't done on pipes before. In other words, I followed the service manual specs instead of my 'feel.' The thinner steel (true for most aftermarket exhaust flanges for the Road Star), combined with the fact that they are made from mild steel, meant that I should have used much less torque than Yamaha specifies. In addition, because my flanges bent so far, they bent the exhaust-studs, too. In the end, I had to replace all the studs and un-warp (re-flatten) the flanges on my new pipes. My exhaust flanges are not removable from the pipes, and no trustworthy muffler or machine shop was handy, so I did it myself. This article describes how I straightened my own exhaust header flanges and replaced my exhaust header studs. Note: This article assumes you know how to normally remove and install the exhaust system, including how to remove the right-side floorboard for the front pipe. If not, refer to the Road Star Service Manual and/or the manufacturer's installation instructions for your exhaust system.   Read more...   Intro to BMS Choppers and Sam Nehme Saturday, 20 March 2010 Take a look at this bike. I have never seen anything like it, at any bike show, anywhere. Having seen this bike in person, I can tell you that the pictures do it no justice. Its an unbelievable work of art, with so many examples of one off engineering and special touches that you will be taking notes and looking at every little detail for hours. Introducing Nehmesis, multi award winning custom Road Star built and engineered by Sam Nehme and crew at BMS Choppers. The Clinic's members will be interviewing Sam and his crew over the next week or so in our forum. We are going to find out what makes this crew tick, and maybe get some ideas for projects of our own. Stay tuned to our forum for more details on how you can participate and what other custom builders have signed on for this new series. I recently had the opportunity to be very close to BMS on a business trip and decided to take the time to check them out for myself. It was a day filled with so many surprises that I didn't want to leave when the time came. So to give everyone a proper introduction to this crew of over the top builders, read along and learn what I found out when I payed them a visit. I can tell you right now they are not who you think they are. And after my visit to their shop I lost my objectivity. So this isn't an objective news article. I am going to try really hard not to sound like a pre-teen girl talking about her favorite boy band rock star.

This sensor is called the Throttle Position Sensor -- or TPS. Theoretically, the more you twist your right wrist, the more demand is placed on the engine, and the less the ignition timing should be advanced. In real life riding this theory has a few holes, but in my experience the TPS still out-performs other available methods for the Road Star carburetors, including V.O.E.S. and M.A.P. (See the Installing a V.O.E.S. article in this website for more information on VOES and MAP). The TPS offers the potential for better torque at all speeds, better fuel economy, and longer engine life. Unfortunately, few aftermarket carbs include a way to connect the TPS. Carburetors built for high performance (racing) applications have no need for variable ignition timing since it is assumed that the engine demands will always be maximum, and therefore the mechanic just sets the timing to a fixed point. For many owners however, the temptation to upgrade from the stock carb to achieve more power, quicker response, more reliability, and easier tune-ability outweighs the benefits that the TPS provides, and so the TPS comes out with the stock carb. In an effort to have both a better carburetor and proper ignition-advance, a few ingenious owners have fabricated custom brackets for certain, popular, aftermarket carbs to adapt their stock TPS. However, most have simply ignored the engine's needs for variable ignition timing in their thirst for more peak horsepower. My design has one moving part: an axle. The axle is rotated via an integrated pulley that accepts the throttle pull cable -- which has been slightly shortened. The end of the little axle is fastened directly into the TPS, which moves the same way as it did in the stock carb. Another, tandem pulley, integrated into my axle, accepts a very short cable that, in turn, actuates my aftermarket carb. My project construction boiled down to just seven, simple, yet time consuming steps: (1) Fabricating the axle, (2) Fabricating a basic pulley, (3) Finishing the pulley for dual cables, (4) Fabricating the framework or plates, (5) Fabricating a mounting bracket and cable receiver, (6) Ordering new throttle cables, and (7) Fabricating a dust cover.

Others favor their aftermarket Mikuni HSR 42mm or 45mm, while still others are sold out to the S&S Super-G, using an aftermarket manifold. However, it is hard to argue with the incredible performance of the Genesis Big Air, 48mm carb from P.S.I. It is an enormous improvement, as others have also written. See Appendix-A for more information and my experiences with this amazing carburetor. This is not an inexpensive project, compared to some others you could do. However, in terms of cost per power improvement, it begins to look very reasonable. Prepare for sticker shock in the neighborhood of $1,500 for the privilege of escalating yourself into the realm of fuel injection equivalent power. Now, with my Genesis carb, I can more than keep up with the fuel injected models, without unduly sacrificing gas mileage. Frankly, when you compare the performance and price of fuel injection to the Genesis carb, it doesn't look so pricey anymore. Heres what I did to install my Genesis Series IV carb on my Road Star. Note: This article applies to model years 1999-2007. If your Road Star is a model year 2008 or later, your bike is fuel injected, and has no carburetor. Important Note: This article assumes you have some mechanical familiarity with the carburetor of your bike. If you question your skill in working with the intake systems of motorcycles you should not attempt this project (in my opinion).

Total time was about 2 1/2 hours. It probably could have been done in 45 minutes to an hour but I was taking pics and making notes. I recently acquired a set of "Hurricane Studded" bags from Mike Battles at Custom Classic Saddlebags, which happened to come with a set of Easy Brackets. The Hurricane's are generic bags not made specifically for the Road Star (more about the bags at the end of the article), so this set of instructions should apply to just about any bike with Generic bags assuming the correct Easy Bracket kit is ordered to fit the bike. Parts: Easy Brackets Kit (part number YMA-R2BR for Silverado with stock backrest) 4 Docking Posts (in kit) 4 8mm polished ss button head bolts (in kit) 8 3/8 x 1 black button head bolt (in kit) 8 3/8 nylon locking nut (in kit) 8 3/8 fender washer (in kit) barrel key (in kit) Hurricane Studded bags from Custom Classic Saddlebags Read more...   Mark Cole's $100 Passing Lamps Monday, 26 May 2008 Mark Garetz at www.vstar1100.com originally put this idea together.  Mark Cole (Mark7) adapted it to work on his Road Star, and after a very favorable reception on our forum, agreed to write out this set of instructions for the benefit of other members of the Clinic.
