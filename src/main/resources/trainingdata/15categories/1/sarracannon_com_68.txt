Are you ready for a BRAND-NEW WEREWOLF series from me...? Grab A Copy Here: http://amzn.to/2u6WY4P Wanna Know More About Moon Kissed: Something sinister lurks in the Mirror Lake woods… Life is different for those living in the Mirror Lake Trailer Park, especially where Mina Ryan is concerned. She’s been waiting years for her werewolf gene to trigger, and the clock is ticking. If she isn’t Moon Kissed soon, Mina runs the risk of becoming an outsider to more than just the townspeople of Mirror Lake. Unless her werewolf gene triggers in the coming months, Mina will become an outsider within her pack as well. It’s almost an unthinkable fate, one Mina finds herself needing to be distracted from. And who better to distract her than Alec Thomas, a charming Southern cutie…who happens to be human? Alec isn’t the only one who’s captured her attention, though. The handsome Alpha’s son, Eli Vargas, has his eye on her as well, much to the pack’s approval. Bigger issues for Mina arise when she learns one of her pack members has gone missing and that she might know something about their disappearance. There’s only one person Mina can turn to for help. Too bad she has a hard time trusting herself when she’s around him… As the mystery grows while two men vie for Mina’s attention and the next full moon looms closer, it’s all Mina can do to keep her head and heart in check.

The deadliest secrets are the ones we keep from ourselves… One year ago, seventeen-year-old Marayah Freeman nearly died in a tragic car accident that also took the life of her best friend, Hailey. Memories of the accident plague Marayah, but no one believes they’re real. They say there was no shadowy figure on the bridge that night. No oil-black tears running down Hailey's face. No guy who appeared from a bright light in the forest. Frustrated, Marayah locks those memories away and tries to focus on the future, but the past keeps pulling her back. A guy who looks like the stranger from the forest enrolls in her school, and her nightmares are getting worse. But when she finds a note in her locker, the mystery of the accident becomes more terrifying than ever. The note is from Hailey. “Marayah, If I’m dead— it wasn’t an accident.” __________________________________ I'm so excited to finally reveal this amazing cover from Ravven!!!
