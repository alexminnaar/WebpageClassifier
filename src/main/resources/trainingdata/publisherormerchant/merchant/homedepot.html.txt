Date published: 2017-02-21 Rated 4 out of 5 by PittD from Surprisingly sturdy I bought this for my newly renovated family room. It is entirely metal, and I wasn't sure of how sturdy it would be. I was very pleasantly surprised. It is very sturdy, and looks quite lovely. Date published: 2016-09-27 Rated 3 out of 5 by Junie3 from Nice industrial shelves Bought 2 of the taller shelves, were relatively easy to assemble, but takes two people to move. Some minor paint damage but overall like them. Date published: 2016-09-20 Rated 5 out of 5 by tucker from look really nice look really nice Date published: 2016-11-16 Rated 5 out of 5 by Panther from These metal shelving units are great! I first saw these shelves in a magazine ad and cut out the page for future reference. When we finally moved into our new home, I knew exactly where they should go. They are stylish, very sturdy, and provide ample storage space while keeping that corner of our family room light and airy. Love the "criss-cross" design on the sides and back of each shelf! Date published: 2016-03-23 Rated 5 out of 5 by kteck from Really nice bookcase Only complaint would be that two shelves in each pack arrived scratched and the welding looked off. I was able to turn the shelves around to face the back so not really a big deal. The color is black but has an almost brushed/crackled gold over spray to them. Very nice and industrial looking.
