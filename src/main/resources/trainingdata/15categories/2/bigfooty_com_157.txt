Thanks for joining Squiggle 2017! This is the continuation of a journey that started here, with a chart of squiggly lines representing the race for the flag. Here's the end result from the last few years: ​Ahhh, 2016, you so crazy. Squiggles are based on a simple model that you can read more about under INFO here. It looks only at scores and home ground advantage. Despite this, it's a fairly solid tipper, averaging 73% over the last 5 years, which goes to show how far you can go with only a little information. And it's a good excuse to talk about footy in an analytical way but without getting too technical. Plus they're super pretty. Here's the starting point for 2017! Positions are calculated from 2016 performance only: They don't take into consideration list changes, injuries, the fact that 90% of GWS is made up of first round draft picks just coming into their prime, and so on. ​ And here's the result of a run through the squiggle ladder predictor: ​ This has been a tumultuous off-season, with Essendon regaining half a side, North axing one, and Ross Lyon learning to care about winning again. So there may be more teams than usual moving far up and down the ladder compared to usual. But going on 2016 form alone, this is how they line up. I want to say up-front that I'm pretty sure I'm going to spend this year charting how awesome GWS are, especially compared to my own team. So each weekly update will be like swallowing needles. But I'm prepared to do it. Live squiggle! Play through past years, drag teams to where you think they belong and generate new season forecasts, and play what-if with Squiggle Sliding Doors!   Final Siren, Feb 15, 2017 #1 Reply dblstR, Golumless, Joao and 152 others like this.

Teams usually move toward the middle (50/50) between seasons, because I drop one year's worth of results. The Dogs' 2016 finishing position is comprised of their 2015 + 2016 games, but their starting position is based on 2016 only. By the end of the year, it will be based on their 2016 + 2017 games.   Final Siren, Feb 15, 2017 #14 Reply Dr Tigris, Striker475, KissKiss and 5 others like this.

Clems Knee Norm Smith Medallist Fremantle Other teams: Joined: Aug 09 Posts: 5,543 Location: Perth Thanks for the squiggle. I hope the teams start moving their positions early in the season (especially my team). I tried to drag all teams to 60 for attack and 60 for defence, to see how much the fixture benefitted teams, but the predictor wouldn't recalculate the season. Any idea of how to do this?   Clems Knee, Feb 15, 2017 #16 Reply Chaisa Norm Smith Medallist Sydney Other teams: The Exers Joined: Jun 13 Posts: 7,302 How did the Pies get so high?   Chaisa, Feb 15, 2017 #17 Reply HolyRioli Norm Smith Medallist Hawthorn Other teams: Leeds Utd Joined: May 09 Posts: 6,032 Location: Perth Oh yes, back in   HolyRioli, Feb 15, 2017 #18 Reply iluvparis likes this. igon value Club Legend Fremantle Other teams: Joined: Oct 16 Posts: 2,137 Final Siren - do you have a screen shot of the starting point of last year?

Click to expand... Sorry, dragging & recalculating should work now. With fixture bias, the major source (for squiggle purposes, at least) is which interstate teams you get at home vs away. Ideally you want your away interstate games to be matches you would have won or lost at home anyway, while your home interstate games are against evenly-matched opponents where the venue makes a critical difference. That's not something you can check by dragging teams around, though. I think it's a very even fixture based on number of home/away interstate games alone. I get everyone on 11 wins when I put them at 50/50 and run through the season.   Final Siren, Feb 15, 2017 #20 Reply iluvparis likes this.

Click to expand... GWS moved a long way last year: ​ You can see this by hovering over their flag on the 2016 live squiggle. And you can see the starting positions for that year by using the player controls at the top.   Final Siren, Feb 15, 2017 #21 Reply Headless and Mofra like this.
