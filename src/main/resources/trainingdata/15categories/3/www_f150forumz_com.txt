We are excited to bring you a product that can give that Off Road Race Truck look and provide the rugged durability you will need in the desert. These Ford Raptor Bumpers have been CAD designed so they mold to the shape of the Raptor and flow with the design. Each Ford Raptor Bumper comes with light tabs, powder coat, and a 1/8 dimple died skid plate. 3/16 skid plates are available for an extra charge. Most of our bumpers can fit up to four 9 lights, which works out great when youre out in the middle of the desert. All Ford Raptor Bumpers are custom made in the USA with all American material.
