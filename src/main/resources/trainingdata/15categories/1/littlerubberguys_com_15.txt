Thinking of buying some soon. 0 Back to top #2 Spiritcrusher Spiritcrusher Serious Collector Members 151 posts Gender:Male Location:Virginia, USA Posted 07 June 2017 - 08:13 AM If you can find them at decent prices in the states. I wouldn't pay extra money to have them shipped from overseas. I have most of them, and they are cool and interesting. But I way over paid for mine when I was collecting them. It's not a popular or well liked Line, so it's no need to pay a bunch of money for them. 0 Back to top #3 AFCMan AFCMan Serious Collector Members 253 posts Gender:Male Location:Aylesbury, United Kingdom Posted 07 June 2017 - 10:44 AM Ahh,,,I'm in the UK. What's a reasonable price per figure? 0 Back to top #4 Draznar Draznar LRG Elite LRG Council 4907 posts Gender:Male Location:Ontario, Canada Interests:Battle Beasts and Boba Fett! Posted 07 June 2017 - 12:06 PM I would say no more than $10 per figure. I've seen them go for $5 a piece on multiple occasions. 0 Check out my collection!   Follow me on Instagram!   Back to top #5 Ericnilla Ericnilla Keshi Addict Members 8919 posts Gender:Male Location:SoCal Interests:Customs and Collecting Posted 07 June 2017 - 12:25 PM I have a bunch for sale if interested i can get a pics, although id like to sell all at once and not split the lot up. 0 INSTAGRAM Back to top #6 AFCMan AFCMan Serious Collector Members 253 posts Gender:Male Location:Aylesbury, United Kingdom Posted 07 June 2017 - 01:40 PM I just bought a nice little lot off eBay   £150 (about $194) including postage. For 38 figures, works out at a little over $5 per figure.   Rather pleased with this and looking forward to checking them out   1 Back to top #7 Spiritcrusher Spiritcrusher Serious Collector Members 151 posts Gender:Male Location:Virginia, USA Posted 07 June 2017 - 02:51 PM Looks like you did pretty well. I was going to say, $5 to $10 per figure is fair. Now the dilemma, do you open them up or leave them in the package? I opened some of mine and left some in the package. 0 Back to top #8 jkaris jkaris AKIA Site Owner Y/S*N*T Little Rubber Guys 22230 posts Gender:Male Location:West Sacramento, CA Posted 08 June 2017 - 02:52 PM Investing?

Posted 09 June 2017 - 05:37 PM It looks like you nabbed damn near every figure they released too, short of the blind packed translucent figures and the mini bases.

Well friggin' done.   Thanks Draz   i think I'm one short, though. I'm sure I read somewhere that there were 39 figures released, not 38? 0 Back to top #12 Dpsexpress Dpsexpress Budding Collector Members 51 posts Gender:Male Location:Florida Interests:Hardcore collector/ main focus Star Wars but I pretty much love all 80s toys Posted 10 June 2017 - 03:36 AM open em!! loose modern stuff retains almost the same value as moc/mip 0 Follow me on Instagram @Dpsexpress Back to top #13 AFCMan AFCMan Serious Collector Members 253 posts Gender:Male Location:Aylesbury, United Kingdom Posted 10 June 2017 - 04:40 AM open em!! loose modern stuff retains almost the same value as moc/mip   Totally going to!

Posted 11 June 2017 - 05:02 AM It's been awhile since I looked at the Beast Saga stuff, (you're kinda making me miss it now!), but I think you've got a complete set.

I'm only missing the Alligator, which comes in the 'Super Winning' Starter set.   Ebay, here I come!!!   The alligator definitely comes alone! The only set I recall buying was the ocean set. I could be mistaken, but double-check! 0 Check out my collection!   Follow me on Instagram!   Back to top #17 AFCMan AFCMan Serious Collector Members 253 posts Gender:Male Location:Aylesbury, United Kingdom Posted 15 June 2017 - 05:08 AM Just checked. The Alligator was indeed a single figure. Guess the guy I bought them off didn't actually have him. Still, just ordered the 'Super Wins' set off Amazon at a decent price, and the figures in that set look way more badass than their single pack counterparts   The detail on that Alligator is amazing   1 Back to top Back to Beast Saga, DST Battle Beasts, etc. Reply to quoted posts     Clear     LittleRubberGuys.com Forums → Little Rubber Guys Board → Beast Saga, DST Battle Beasts, etc. Privacy Policy Change Theme IP.Board IP.Board Mobile IBR Caja Help Community Forum Software by IP.Board 3.4.4 Copyright © 2017 LittleRubberGuys.com   Sign In Need an account?
