The model was actually introduced in September, 2016 at the Paris Motor Show, but makes its U.S. debut in the Big Apple. Both the sedan and five-door hatchback models are present, sporting larger bodies than their predecessors. The Rio sedan has been lengthened to 172.6 inches from 172.0 inches, while the five-door hatch grows slightly from 159.4 inches to 160.0 inches. Both models ride on a longer 101.6-inch wheelbase (up from 101.2 inches) and feature more upright A-pillars. To give them both a more balanced and athletic stance, the 2018 Kia Rio sits lower and wider than before. In the U.S., the 2018 Kia Rio will be available in three trim levels: LX, S and EX. All three models are powered by a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 130 horsepower and 119 pound-feet of torque. The powerplant is a carryover unit, but has been enhanced for better fuel efficiency, better responsiveness and low-speed driving dynamics. Power is sent to the front wheels through either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission.
