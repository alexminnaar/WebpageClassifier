I know the big question on everyone’s mind when it comes to my books is “When is the next Shadow Demons Saga book coming out?”. Believe me, I completely understand how difficult it can be to wait for a book that you’re dying to read, and I’m so incredibly grateful that you guys are excited about Beyond The Darkness. I had hoped to have a release date ready for you by the end of this month, but here we are on the last day of February, and I’m sad to say that I’m not ready to announce a date quite yet. Thank you so much to everyone who is waiting patiently (and even those of you waiting not so patiently). It means a lot to me that you guys love this series as much as I do! I want to give you the very best book I can write and that takes a lot of time and energy nine books into a series. I promise that I am working on the book every day, and it’s getting closer and closer to time. When I do have more exciting news to share, I promise I will shout the release date from the rooftops!

I can’t wait, and was just talking about the series to co-workers, yesterday. Will your books ever be available in print? Reply Christa says April 22, 2017 at 3:24 pm I am so excited for the new book! I have read them again and again and again throughout the past two months and I love them ❤️❤️❤️ The last book made me so sad and my family can’t understand the obsession I have around these books! Looking forward for the next book!! Reply "Frustrated" :( Fan says August 17, 2017 at 10:01 am Hi Sarra- so I posted a comment recently about being a frustrated Demons saga reader without reading your posted from a few months ago. I feel ashamed now bc I guess I didn’t realize how you read these personally and take them to such heart. I hope you just know that I am an INCREDIBLY HUGE FAN and LOVE your books. I will keep this short but want you to know that I think you’re amazing and to obviously take the time you need to create your wonderful books. I hope you can except my sincere apology and know it was NOTHING personal. I NEVER comment on these things and was only doing it out of my intense passion for your books that I have been reading for years and excited for whatever comes next. You are truly talented and as I mentioned before I understand creating what you do takes time- I guess I just don’t want to wait! 🙂 apologies again and I hope everything you are personally dealing with is working out. You are a fantastic writer and I early await whatever you have instore for us next and I hope you can understand where I was coming from too- it wasn’t a dark place. Take care of yourself first and thank you again for the joy your books have brought me!!! Reply Robin Jinkins says March 2, 2017 at 10:50 pm It’ll be worth it I’m sure!!!!! Maybe I’ll re read the others to refresh my memory. 😉 Reply Red says March 13, 2017 at 1:05 pm i remember everything!!!! Im so damn sad cause of the last book! I was about to cry Reply Tina Haywood says March 3, 2017 at 4:34 pm Looking forward to Beyond the darkness as just read the other 8 books plus wrath in 2 weeks. No TV just my kindle as could not stop reading. I am 58 so no teenager and love these sort of sagas as I’m sure all ages young at heart to much younger do to. Many thanks Sarra. Reply Frustrated Fan says August 15, 2017 at 2:09 am Hi Sarra- I’m also not a teenager. I’m in my mid-30s and a HUGE fan of this series. In fact, I just re-read all of them again because I am eagerly awaiting the next book. I subscribe to your news updates and, if I am being totally honest, I must say I do I find it a little frustrating and more than disappointing when I’ve seen a couple times you are working on a totally new series. I mean I know you have every right to express your creative and wonderful talent however you see fit and putting the time in that you so evidently do to create and deliver the captivating and wonderful reads us demon fans have come to expect from you but don’t you think you owe it to your fans to focus on finishing out the series?? I mean I can’t tell you how many comments I have read of people rereading the series to make sure they are caught up and refreshed so AS SOON as the next book is released they want to make sure they haven’t forget a single detail and can continue their journey without missing the wonderful details that your carry from one book to the next. I usually wouldn’t comment on such a thing because I can’t imagine the time and effort it takes to create the world you have for your fans but I’m also sure you can imagine the torture for your fans to get through 10 books just to be left hanging!! And in most cases that would be fine knowing the author is focusing on the next installment but it’s complete torture knowing that you’re not!! I mean does anyone else share my pain here?!! All I’m saying is that although I’m excited for you in the fact that you seem excited about a new series or another “Hope” book …please don’t forget about us Demon fans. We are all fiercely devoted to you and your series and need the journey not only to continue but closure as well!! Sincerely, A huge fan Ps- Hate to pick but I do have a question that has been bugging me that I was hoping someone could explain to me when they have time?? So when Harper is in the demon world being half human I understand why they describe her appearance and dress in human terms but when Lea and Aerden return- he talks about loving her hair and braid when she was young and they braid her hair and put makeup on her and whatnot to dress her up as a princess when she comes home to the northern kingdom but isn’t she in demon form there?? Why would she have her braid and why does areden still loom human to other demons with his hair “falling in his eyes”. He’s a demon! And the only reason he looked that way was because Harper and Maryann took a potion. To see them that way or they were in the human world- right?? Found it confusing…am I missing something?? Truly curious!! Thanks!! Reply Lupita says March 13, 2017 at 12:22 pm I am ver excited to see what’s next in the Shadow Demons Saga it was kind of a cliff hanger for them, i started to re-read the previous ones to refresh and take the anticipation edge off. Reply Diane says March 14, 2017 at 11:03 pm I just finished book 8 and can’t wait until 9 comes out…hope it’s soon! Reply Theresa says March 20, 2017 at 8:39 am I just read a comment from Tina that said she is 58 & no teenager. I thought I was the oldest one reading this series. It’s exciting to see I’m not the only woman that’s in her golden years reading your books. I’ll be 62yrs old in April. Been reading your books for a few years. I find them well written & you keep me guessing through out the series. Other than constantly reading how much they love each other (we both know men don’t reveal undying love for their woman/wife/gf/mate/soul mate as much as Jackson keeps telling himself he loves Harper) he’s much older & world wise than she is. At 16 or even 17 girls don’t know & couldn’t know how the world really is. I’m not trying to rain on your parade. I love your books. I don’t think of Harper as being so very young & inexperienced. Do you really want the girls/women that read your books to believe there is a shining white knight waiting to sweep them off their feet after the girl saves herself & all of her friends? I know your writing & wanting to appeal to the younger set. Shouldn’t you be truthful with your readers. Life is not now nor has ever been a fairy tale. I’m sorry if my comments make you/your fans angry. I really started out just to say I love your books, but…..you asked for an honest how I feel about your writing. I did just that, so people please realize I’m only one person with an opinion. We all know what they say about opinions………Sarra, keep writing I’m looking forward to the 9th book in your Demon Sieries. And thank you for sharing your writings with us. Reply Leshni says March 21, 2017 at 1:17 pm Hello Sarra …I just wanted to tell u that I AM IN LOVE WITH THE SHADOW DEMONS BOOKS..I AM OBSESSED AND I CAN’T WAIT FOR THE RELEASE OF THE OTHER BOOKS… I think I might be one of the youngest reader here…I’m 13 soon 14 and i first read your book when I was 12 and well I must say that this series of book will always be my favorite book series.. I am in love with all the characters especially jackson…and harper.. I am very curious of how will the events turn out in the upcoming books… I have the entire series more than 10 times….seriously I am not joking when i say i am obsessed.. I even force all my friends (literally) to read this book but at the end of the day they start to get addicted to the books..I keep gushing about Jackson..Like he is MY FAVE… I just wanted you to know that I really like the way you write the characters…the way you write…It’s kinda hypnotising… Reply Vatsal says April 2, 2017 at 4:07 am I think i am going mad but still this all is worth a shot. I have emailed u twice and send few dm’s and comments on Instagram but again one of my friend(swarni), her birthday is coming up this month on 14th and she is a huge fan of yours. We are from India and she reads your shadow demons saga like a ritual and has been obsessed with Harper. Could you please wish her along with your autograph and forward me a image she is not on any social media or else i would have forwarded you her link. Please ma’am ? Reply Nicole says April 12, 2017 at 3:10 am I can’t wait for this book to come out, I love this series I never want it to end! Reply Maryanne cook says April 20, 2017 at 5:31 am Am rereading the books as I try to refresh on what has gone on and I’m still gripped lol can’t wait and see what awaits Harper Jackson and the gang this time as all ways it’s a great read for all ages I’m 29 ando love them keep getting otherstarted to read it and they are hooked too Reply Melissa Rose Ball says April 27, 2017 at 5:27 pm Hello. I’ve just finished reading your amazing Shadow Demons Saga book 8. It says to go to reed the next book, book 9 Beyond The Darkness but it seems that it hasn’t been published yet. I can’t wait to read it. I’ve got A Demons Wrath part 1&2 and After Midnight on hand to read but I would like to read book 9 before I attempt to read them other ones. Scoop excited for Beyond The Darkness to be published to read sometime in the near future; I hope 🙂 Reply Melissa Rose Ball says April 27, 2017 at 5:30 pm Hello.

Just a suggestion for your enjoyment and also try reading Red in Once Upon a Kiss another story she wrote that has to do with this series and the Ruby Priestess it’s pretty good just too short. Leaves you wanting more. Reply Sam says June 8, 2017 at 2:34 am Thank you so much for such a great series. Cannot wait until the 9 book arrives! Reply sagar says June 25, 2017 at 1:34 pm Hi, very nice article, keep up the good work Reply Barb says June 30, 2017 at 4:35 pm How is Beyond the Darkness coming along? Still waiting. Reply Janice Donahue says August 2, 2017 at 3:50 am Looking forward to next book, just read the series again. Any date yet? Reply Ogwa says August 3, 2017 at 10:22 am HI Sara. I am in Nigeria, West Africa and I want to say your books are the best ever. I am dying to read the next book in The Demons Series. Kudos!!!
