Welcome! In our day and age, most people are consumers. This saddens me. Why? Because Do-it-yourself is not just a way to save money. It is empowering! A lot of people believe that they aren‚Äôt handymen, that they can‚Äôt do small repairs around the house. That they can‚Äôt remodel their homes & make their dreams come true. I‚Äôm, 100% sure, that this isn‚Äôt true! Fortunatly. I encourage you to embrace DIY as a way of life, a way of thinking. As a long time woodworker i‚Äôve always been interested in shaping the world around me. I don‚Äôt accept to live in a world without personal responsibility. What i do, i do right. What about you? Are you ready to take matters into your own hands? Are you prepared to put in the hard work, to manifest your dreams?
