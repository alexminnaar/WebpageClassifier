Along with the racing has come many thousands of km's towing the boats to compete in regatta's. Southern Spain is not even remotely central to the A Cat Circuit in Central Europe. Even so,our yearly season is made up ofregular particpation in the majority of major A Cat Championships , including World Championships in Sweden and Miami and Europeans in Murcia (Handy) , La Baule and Bodensee. Along with many National Championships in Austria,Belgium, France , Holland, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Not to be left out, an Epic trip to Loch Ness for the Inaugaural 'Monster Race'   From experience and lessons learned, a full range of A-Cat Kit is now available online to keep your boat Clean , dry and ready to win races.
