Ok, so I am into this and I am into moving my blog onto this new platform (which will be hugo on Amazon S3). However, hey - when I returned after a short weekend trip I found the following in my windows garden! A chili blossom from a Basket of Fire. Unfortunately I took the F1 Hybrid plants, as I was too greedy for my own chili. Anyways, I’ll try to check the 2nd generation let’s see what’s the result :) Maybe by growing several plants, I might be able to recover the original mother/father plant. But for now - I am happy. I took a QTIP this morning and did the job that bees are doing. Nice, maybe I will turn into one!   Category Grow Simple IOT dumper for MQTT in Lua Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Share this post Twitter Google+ Facebook Reddit LinkedIn StumbleUpon Email pkgbox Blog about technology, motorcycles, growing chilies and photography Recent Posts It's blossoming July 24, 2017 Simple IOT dumper for MQTT in Lua April 20, 2017 There will be rock April 10, 2017 jq - a JSON commandline tool (freifunk) - part I September 8, 2016 German Umlaute with Perl Text::CSV May 20, 2016 View more posts Categories Grow 2 Development 1 About This is a private blog by Ulrich Habel <rhaen@pkgbox.de> Learn More © pkgbox.de - Chili, Motorräder und Tech.
